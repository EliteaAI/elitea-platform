# shellcheck shell=sh
#
# Which caller do the LLM checks run as?
#
# Every one of them needs the same answer: a PAT whose user OWNS a personal
# project, because the /llm hop resolves the provider credential from THAT
# project and a caller without one reports `project_not_resolved` — a true
# statement about the wrong caller.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SHARED FUNCTION AND NOT A QUERY REPEATED THREE TIMES.
# standalone-stack.sh, sdk-client-check.sh and embedding-path-check.sh each
# carried their own copy of that query, and every copy ended
# `ORDER BY t.user_id LIMIT 1`. That named the SEEDED persona only by accident:
# nothing in this stack created a personal project for anybody else, so the
# persona was the only candidate. elitea-main now provisions the caller's
# personal project when it has none
# (services/elitea-main/internal/application/personalproject), and this stack
# triggers it — the #326 edge check calls /social/author as the lowest-id PAT
# owner, dev@elitea.ai. Measured: that gave user 1 a brand-new empty project,
# which then won all three ORDER BYs, and the checks reported "project 2 holds
# no chat model row" while the seeded rows sat in 90003/90106.
#
# Fixing one copy moved the failure to the other two. So the selection lives
# here once, and it selects on the thing the callers are actually about:
# whose personal project HOLDS the seeded chat model row.

# resolve_seeded_driver <reader-fn>
#
# Echoes "<pat-uuid> <project-id>" for the seeded driver, or nothing at all
# when no PAT owns a personal project.
#
# <reader-fn> is the name of a function taking one SQL string and echoing the
# result — each caller already has one, over its own compose project.
#
# The FIRST candidate is kept as the fallback, so a stack whose seed never ran
# still names a project in the caller's own "holds no chat model row" message
# instead of failing against `p_.`.
