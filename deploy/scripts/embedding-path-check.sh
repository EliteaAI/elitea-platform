# Behaviour assertions for the EMBEDDING PATH of a running standalone stack
# (issue #470). Run it after `standalone-stack.sh seed-llm`.
#
#   STANDALONE_PROJECT=<your-own-name> deploy/scripts/embedding-path-check.sh
#
# ── What this adds that nothing else measured ────────────────────────────────
#
# `standalone-stack.sh check` asserted the WIDTH of the returned vector against
# one hardcoded model name. A width identifies no model, a 200 identifies no
# project, and a hardcoded name speaks only to the stack it was written for.
#
# This script reads the seeded names out of the database and then asserts, for
# each probe, three separate facts:
#
#   1. what the platform answered;
#   2. that the upstream provider was really called — read from the mock's own
#      request journal, which is the only record of what went on the wire; and
#   3. WHICH model name and WHICH project's credential that call carried.
#
# Fact 3 is why `seed-llm` gives the mock a per-project key. The credential the
# gateway sends names the project it resolved.
#
# ── The four probes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   A  the seeded embedding model            -> 200, one upstream call, the
#                                               caller's own project credential
#   B  a model name no row holds             -> 404 that NAMES the model, and
#                                               NO upstream call at all
#   C  a public-project model, shared=true   -> listed, and 200 (issue #458)
#   D  a public-project model, shared=false  -> not listed, and 404
#
# Probe B's second half is the one that is easy to leave out. A refusal is only
# safe if nothing was dispatched. A gateway that substituted some other model
# would also answer 200, and only the journal can tell the two apart.
#
# ── Reading the result ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# The last line reports how many assertions RAN and how many failed. A run that
