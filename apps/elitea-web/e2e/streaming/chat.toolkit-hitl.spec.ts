/**
 * The SENSITIVE-ACTION contract: an operator marks a toolkit operation as
 * requiring authorization, the agent asks for it before the call, and the
 * decision the user takes in the browser decides whether the remote effect
 * happens at all.
 *
 * This is the one HITL shape whose failure mode is a real-world effect rather
 * than a stuck conversation. `chat.hitl.spec.ts` covers the clarification
 * pause, whose worst case is an unanswered question; here a control that does
 * not bind a decision to the exact call it was taken for lets a declined
 * action run. The native runtime is explicit about that boundary
 * (`services/elitea-worker-rust/src/agents/direct_hitl.rs`):
 *
 *   - a DENIED call is never dispatched. The real tool is replaced, before the
 *     runner is built, by a local adapter that emits a structured
 *     `sensitive_tool_blocked` result under the ORIGINAL call id;
 *   - an APPROVED call is replayed only when the tool is READ-ONLY
 *     (`is_read_only` — GET/HEAD/OPTIONS for an OpenAPI operation). An
 *     approved EFFECTFUL call is refused with `UnsupportedCapability`:
 *     "approved direct HITL replay remains closed for an effectful tool",
 *     because there is no durable effect receipt yet. That is a stated design
 *     boundary, not a gap in this journey — so the effectful leg here asserts
 *     the DENY path, and the approve leg uses the read-only operation, which
 *     is the one the runtime does admit.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THE ASSERTIONS ARE SHAPED THIS WAY
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  - the pause is asserted by its DECISION CONTROLS, never by its text. The
 *    sensitive card and the generic approve/reject card share one testid
 *    (`chat-hitl-actions`), and a card that renders its warning and no buttons
 *    is exactly the failure `chat.hitl.spec.ts` was written for;
 *  - the decision is asserted at the ROUTE, not by the card disappearing:
 *    `applyHitlOptimisticUpdate` removes it before any transport is chosen;
 *  - the OUTCOME is read from the STORE and from the TOOL journal together.
 *    The store says what the runtime told the model; the journal says whether
 *    the remote effect happened. Only the second can fail a runtime that
 *    reports a block and calls the tool anyway, which is the defect that
 *    matters;
 *  - the denial COMMENT is unique per run and is required to appear inside the
 *    stored blocked result. That is what proves the decision travelled the
 *    whole way — a resume that reached the route but not the runtime would
 *    still leave a second reply.
 *
 * GLOBAL STATE: `sensitive_tools` lives in `centry.platform_config` and there
 * is no narrower scope — `resolveToolkitGuardrails` reads it and nothing else.
 * It is written by the ADMIN persona and restored in `afterEach`, which runs on
 * failure too; every other spec in this project shares the stack and a leaked
 * entry would turn their tool calls into pauses nothing answers.
 *
 * WORKER: the native Rust runtime (`STANDALONE_WORKER=rust`). The whole
 * approve/deny contract above is that runtime's; the SDK worker's sensitive
 * middleware is a different implementation and was not measured here.

  // header — and is therefore not attempted.

  // previous turn went through a HITL resume refused the next start with 422
  // `unsupported_agent_execution` — measured 3/3 against this stack, while a
  // second turn after an ordinary turn and after a non-paused TOOL turn both
  // answered 200. Sending the second turn into the same conversation therefore
  // asserted a race: it passed once, when the send beat the resume's own
  // persistence, and failed on the rerun.
  //
  // THAT REFUSAL IS FIXED. The overlap gate refuses while the conversation
  // holds a response marked as being written, and the start path's settle wait
  // (`resolveAfterCurrentResponseSettles`,
  // services/elitea-main/internal/infra/db/repos/agent_start.go) used to answer
  // with the pre-settle refusal whenever the resume's terminal write landed
  // between its resolve and its settle probe — which is where a resumed run
  // puts it, because `pipeline_finish` and the terminal write are milliseconds
  // apart there. The wait now re-resolves on that report, and
  // `chat.hitl.spec.ts` sends its follow-up into the SAME conversation at the
  // moment the composer is released, which is the assertion that would catch a
  // regression.
  //
  // The separate conversation STAYS, for a reason of its own: the two legs are
  // different decisions on different operations, and giving each its own
