/**
 * The CLARIFYING QUESTION round trip: an agent that stops to ask, a user who
 * answers in the browser, and a run that finishes on that answer.
 *
 * The native Rust runtime's `ask_user` internal tool parks a turn on a durable
 * confirmation and stores an assistant row whose interrupt carries
 * `guardrail_type: 'clarifying_question'`, `available_actions: ['answer']` and
 * a `questions` array with options. Every OTHER pause shape this app renders
 * (approve / reject / edit / block-with-comment) was already wired. This one
 * was not, and the failure was silent in the way that matters most:
 *
 *  1. `ChatHitlActions` knew four actions and `'answer'` matched none of them,
 *     so the pause rendered its question TEXT and ZERO controls — a card that
 *     looks like an answer, on a run nothing can resume;
 *  2. `questions` was dropped by BOTH delivery paths (the stream reducer's
 *     single-pause assembly and the stored-message reader), so even a card
 *     with controls would have had nothing to render them from;
 *  3. `buildHitlContinueBody` refused an `'answer'` action, returning
 *     `undefined` — which the handler reads as "no REST body fits" and falls
 *     back to a socket that is a no-op stub in every shipped deployment. The
 *     resume reached no transport at all.
 *
 * None of the three fails a unit suite: the components are individually
 * correct and the wiring between them is what was missing (the recurring
 * "composition root" class). So this journey drives the WHOLE loop in a
 * browser and asserts the two things a broken loop cannot produce: answer
 * CONTROLS on the pause card, and a stored FINAL answer that quotes what was
 * answered.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THE ASSERTIONS ARE SHAPED THIS WAY
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  - the pause is asserted by its OPTION BUTTON and its SUBMIT, never by the
 *    question text alone: the broken card printed the question too;
 *  - the resume is asserted as a 200 from the continuation ROUTE, not as a
 *    card that disappeared — the handler patches the message optimistically
 *    before any transport is chosen, so the card vanishes even when nothing
 *    was sent;
 *  - the final answer is read from the STORE and must quote the answered
 *    option. The mock's continuation script echoes the substituted tool result
 *    (`MOCK: resumed User answered: …`), so "Staging" in the stored row proves
 *    the answer reached the MODEL — not merely that the route accepted a body.
 *    An answer that never reached it would still store a second reply.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE: `journeys/**` runs against
 * `docker-compose.e2e-standalone.yml`, which has no runtime plane, no worker
 * and no model backend. The `chat-stream` project matches `streaming/chat.*`
 * and runs against the full standalone stack via `scripts/chat-stream-e2e.sh`,
 * serially (`--workers=1`).
 *
 * WORKER: the native Rust runtime (`STANDALONE_WORKER=rust`). `ask_user` is a
 * capability of THAT runtime — the Python worker has no equivalent internal
 * tool — so on a python-worker stack the agent never pauses and this spec
 * fails on its pause card. That is the correct outcome for a spec about a
 * runtime feature; the runtime it needs is stated here rather than guessed.
  *
 * KNOWN RARE RACE (measured, ~1 integrated-suite run in 5): the resume body
 * verifiably carries the answer (this spec asserts the exact wire value and
 * the 200 BEFORE the final check) and the worker still substitutes an EMPTY
 * answer into the tool result. Standalone the spec is consistently green.
 * CI's retries=2 absorb it while the worker-side investigation runs; do not
 * weaken the final assertion to hide it — an empty answer reaching the model
 * is exactly what this journey exists to catch.
