/**
 * An agent whose instructions reference a variable must reach the model with
 * that variable SUBSTITUTED — and this journey reads the substituted prompt
 * back off the wire rather than inferring it from an answer.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS SPEC USED TO SAY, AND WHY IT CHANGED ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Until the native runtime grew variable substitution this file pinned the
 * opposite: `validate_application_meta_variables` admitted `meta.variables`
 * only when it was absent, an empty array or an empty object, and refused a
 * POPULATED list as `UnsupportedCapability` — an honest refusal while nothing
 * substituted them, and one this spec existed to make fail loudly the day it
 * stopped being true. That day arrived. `services/elitea-worker-rust/src/
 * agents/variables.rs` now renders the instructions before the profile is
 * built, and `assembly.rs`'s `validate_application_meta_variables` admits the
 * populated shapes the renderer consumes. The refusal shape this file used to
 * demonstrate is still pinned elsewhere — `chat.attachments.spec.ts` (an
 * attached file) and `chat.mcp.spec.ts` (an `http` MCP endpoint).
 *
 * ── THE CONTRACT, TRACED TO THE SDK IT PORTS ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The renderer is a port of the SDK worker's own behaviour, measured at the
 * revision `services/elitea-worker-python/elitea-sdk.lock.json` pins
 * (elitea-sdk 0.9.8 @ b5113a12): `runtime/langchain/assistant.py:557-576`
 * captures `{name, value}` rows whose value is neither null nor empty, and
 * `:597-657` renders the instructions through
 * `SandboxedEnvironment(undefined=DebugUndefined)` — real Jinja2, not string
 * replacement, so an UNDEFINED name survives as the literal `{{ name }}` and a
 * malformed template reaches the model unrendered instead of ending the turn.
 * The Rust port reproduces all three (its unit tests pin the undefined,
 * malformed and fast-path cases); this journey pins the one thing a unit test
 * cannot: that the value the USER stored through the API reaches the MODEL.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ASSERTION READS THE MOCK'S JOURNAL, NOT THE ANSWER ─────────────
 *
 * Substitution rewrites the SYSTEM prompt and nothing else. The offline mock
 * answers with an echo of the last USER message (`deploy/mock-llm/server.py`,
 * `_reply_for`), so an assertion on the stored answer would read back the
 * question — identical whether `{{topic}}` was substituted, left literal, or
 * dropped. It would pass against every one of those, which is to say it would
 * assert nothing. The mock's MODEL journal records each request's system
 * prompt for exactly this reason (`_system_text`, surfaced as
 * `MockLlmJournalEntry.instructions`), and that is the only server-side,
 * model-independent evidence of what the runtime assembled.
 *
 * ── WHY THE MODEL IS PINNED ON THE VERSION ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Same reason `chat.hitl.spec.ts` pins it: an application turn runs on
 * `version_details.llm_settings.model_name`, and an empty `llm_settings` falls
 * back to whatever the project catalogue calls its default — which on a stack
 * that also carries a real provider is not the mock, and then the journal this
 * spec reads would hold no entry for the turn at all.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS SPEC SETS THE VARIABLE THROUGH THE API, NOT THE FORM ──────────
 *
 * Unchanged from the original, and still measured: there is no form control
 * that AUTHORS a new variable NAME in this app's ported manual edit page.
 * `ApplicationVariables`/`AgentVariables`
 * (`src/features/agents/ui/ApplicationVariables.tsx`, `AgentVariables.tsx`)
 * both render existing rows only — each returns `null` outright when its
 * `variables` prop is empty, so there is no "add variable" affordance to
 * click. The one place this codebase DOES derive a variable NAME from
 * `{{name}}` placeholders in the instructions text — porting the legacy app's
 * `contextResolver`/`extractPlaceholders` (`src/shared/lib/string.ts`) — is
 * wired into exactly one flow, the AI-generate-agent draft approval
 * (`src/features/agents/ui/generate-agent-modal/useAgentDraftApproval.ts:151`).
 * The manual `CreateAgentForm`/`InstructionsInput.tsx` path this suite's own
 * `createAgentThroughForm` drives has no such wiring, so typing `{{topic}}`
 * into the instructions box does nothing to `version_details.variables`. This
 * journey therefore reaches for the same door the form's own save uses:
 * `PUT .../version/prompt_lib/{project}/{application}/{version}` with a
 * `variables` array, exactly the `VersionWriteRequest.variables:
 * VersionVariable[]` shape `useSaveVersion.ts` sends (and which
 * `services/elitea-main/internal/api/v2/applications/handler.go:915-933`
 * folds into `application_versions.meta` — the identical column the runtime
 * reads). If a variables-authoring control is ever added to this edit page,
 * this spec should switch to driving it.
 *
 * ── WHY BOTH WORKER LEGS NOW RUN THE SAME ASSERTION ────────────────────────
 *
 * They did not always. Until the projection was fixed, this file ran the
 * journal assertion on the native leg alone and let the SDK leg assert only
 * that the turn was admitted and answered — because on the SDK leg the
 * substitution was not reachable from this platform's DATA at all. Main's
 * `application_version_details_json` built `'variables', '[]'::jsonb`
 * unconditionally, so the SDK's primary source (`data['variables']`) always
 * arrived empty, and its only other source — `meta['variables']` — is guarded
 * by `isinstance(meta['variables'], dict)` (`assistant.py:574`) while Main
 * stores an ARRAY.
 *
 * That projection now carries the version's real list, read out of the same
 * `application_versions.meta` the HTTP write folds it into and the same place
 * `versionDetailsResponse` reads it back from
 * (`services/elitea-main/internal/db/queries/agent_chat.sql`,
 * `internal/api/v2/applications/handler.go`). The pinned SDK is satisfied by
 * that alone — no patch was added to the two in
 * `services/elitea-worker-python/elitea-sdk.lock.json` — and the substitution
 * is proved against the real wheel by
 * `services/elitea-worker-python/tests/unit/test_agent_variables.py`. So the
 * branch is gone and the journal assertion below is now the SAME contract on
 * both runtimes: whichever worker answers the turn, the VALUE the user stored
 * must be in the system prompt the model received.
 *
 * ── WHERE THIS LIVES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `streaming/`, matched by the `chat-stream` project (`playwright.config.ts`),
 * because an agent turn needs the full standalone stack's runtime plane and a
 * real worker — see `chat.agent.spec.ts`'s header for why the plain
 * `journeys/` stack cannot run this at all.
