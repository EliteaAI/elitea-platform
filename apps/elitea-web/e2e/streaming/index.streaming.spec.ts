/**
 * Index definition-of-done journey (#93 "Surface A", validating #296).
 *
 * The behavioural gate for the OTHER product loop that runs on the execution
 * plane: open a toolkit, fill the create-index form, start a run, watch it
 * progress, and see it terminate — all through the product's own UI.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS FILE IS NOT UNDER e2e/journeys/
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Same reason as `chat.streaming.spec.ts`: the `chromium`/`webkit` projects run
 * against `docker-compose.e2e-standalone.yml`, which has no runtime plane and
 * no agent worker, so an index run cannot happen there at all. This journey
 * gets its own Playwright project (`index-stream`), driven by
 * `scripts/index-stream-e2e.sh`, which also runs `seed-index` — the three rows
 * (vector store, embedding model, indexable toolkit) without which the start
 * route cannot resolve a toolkit.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT MAKES THESE ASSERTIONS DISCRIMINATING
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Until commit 5f0fe33d, elitea-main served every toolkit tool's argument
 * schema as the placeholder `{"type":"object"}`. The client builds this form
 * from `properties.selected_tools.args_schemas.index_data`, so it rendered ZERO
 * inputs and `isValidForm` was pinned false (`IndexDetails.tsx`: "if
 * (!adjustedIndexDataSchema?.properties) return false") — the `Index` button
 * was permanently disabled and an index could not be started from the UI at
 * all, while every unit suite stayed green.
 *
 * §1 therefore asserts SCHEMA-DERIVED DOM ATTRIBUTES, not merely "a field
 * exists": `maxlength="32"` comes from the served `index_name.maxLength`, and
 * the slider's `min`/`max` come from `progress_step`'s 0-100 bounds. Neither
 * value can be produced by `{"type":"object"}`, and neither is hardcoded
 * anywhere in the client — so this section fails against the pre-5f0fe33d
 * backend and passes only against the real schema.
 *
 * §4's terminal state is likewise not free. The client writes an OPTIMISTIC
 * `state: in_progress` row into its own store the moment `Index` is clicked
 * (`useToolkitChat.hooks.ts`), so a run that never reaches the browser still
 * paints a rail entry. Only the SSE terminal frame flips the action bar to
 * edit mode. `the terminal state comes off the stream, not a client-side
 * guess` (below) is the negative guard that proves it: with the events stream
 * blocked, the very same click must NOT reach that terminal state.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * §7 — THE PIPELINE, NOT ONLY THE SCREEN (issue #470)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This journey used to index ZERO documents and still finish green, and its own
 * header recorded that as expected: the SDK listed its bucket over an
 * S3-compatible API that elitea-main did not serve, and swallowed the 404 into
 * an empty listing. Commits c951afe2, f54e3a82 and 2ef4f462 now serve that
 * surface, so the reason has gone.
 *
 * A `0 / 0` journey proved the screen works and proved nothing about the
 * 18-hop embedding path underneath it. Two real defects on that path (#468,
 * #458) were found by reading and passed every gate.
 *
 * §0 therefore PUTS A DOCUMENT IN THE BUCKET first, through the product's own
 * artifact API, and §7 then asserts three things a green run cannot give on its
 * own:
 *
 *   - the server's own index record reports at least one indexed document;
 *   - the provider was really called, read from the mock's request journal;
 *   - the call carried the expected model NAME and the caller's own project
 *     credential. A vector width identifies no model, and a 200 identifies no
 *     project.
 *
 * MEASURED, and it matters for how these assertions are read: a run over an
 * EMPTY bucket still makes 2 single-input embedding calls, from the vector
 * store's own set-up, and reports `indexed: 0` with state `completed`. So "an
 * embedding call happened" is NOT by itself evidence that a document was
 * embedded. §7a — the stored document count — is the assertion that carries
 * that, and §7b to §7d exist to identify the model and the project, not the
 * count.
 *
 * The journal is served by `deploy/mock-llm/server.py` and published on
 * STANDALONE_MOCK_PORT. `seed-llm` gives each project its own mock key, so the
 * credential the gateway sends names the project it resolved.
