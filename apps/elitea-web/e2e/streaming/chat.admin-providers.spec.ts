/**
 * The ADMIN surface behind chat's model connections: publishing a platform
 * provider credential, watching it stop resolving, and repairing it with
 * **Re-validate** rather than by re-saving the row.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY A `chat.` FILE FOR AN ADMIN SCREEN
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The file name is a ROUTING fact, not a claim about the subject. The
 * `chat-stream` project matches `streaming/chat.*.spec.ts`
 * (`playwright.config.ts`), and this journey needs the stack that project
 * brings up. It is not an arbitrary neighbour either: every model a chat turn
 * can address resolves through one of these rows, and `status_ok` is the column
 * that decides whether the gateway will use it at all. A credential that stops
 * resolving here is a chat that answers "model not found" three services away.
 *
 * It cannot run in `journeys/**`. That project drives
 * `docker-compose.e2e-standalone.yml`, where the revalidate route does not
 * compose: re-running ADMISSION needs the Configurations runtime
 * (`ELITEA_CONFIGURATIONS_ENABLED`) — it owns the reference expander and the
 * project vault the decision reads — together with production auth, and that
 * stack has one without the other. The full standalone stack this project uses
 * has both, so the route answers with a decision instead of a 503.
 *
 * IDENTITY: the ADMIN persona, not this project's default chat driver. The
 * whole `/admin/gateway` group takes the central `configuration.governance`
 * permission (`services/elitea-main/internal/api/router.go`), which the seed
 * grants to `e2e-admin@autotest.local` alone. `auth.setup.ts` authenticates all
 * three personas on every run, so the state is already on disk — this file only
 * has to name which one.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, AND WHY EACH ONE IS SHAPED THIS WAY
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. **A freshly created provider does not break the listing.** This is the F1
 *    regression, measured through this exact panel: `POST /providers` answered
 *    201 and every subsequent `GET /admin/gateway/providers` answered 500
 *    `{"error":"list failed"}` —
 *
 *        can't scan into dest[9] (col: updated_at): cannot scan NULL into *time.Time
 *
 *    `updated_at` is nullable and Create writes only `created_at`, so a
 *    brand-new row HAS a NULL there; the listing scanned it into a `time.Time`
 *    and pgx refused the row. A listing raises that per ROW, so one new
 *    credential took the whole screen down for every operator — publishing a
 *    provider bricked the surface for publishing providers. The assertion is
 *    the row RENDERING after its own create, plus `updated_at: ''` on the wire,
 *    which is the never-updated state the crash needed.
 *
 * 2. **A dead credential reference is reported as `status_ok: false`.** Nothing
 *    else on this platform displays that column, and the gateway admits
 *    `status_ok = true` and nothing else.
 *
 * 3. **Repairing the WORLD does not repair the ROW — Re-validate does.** The
 *    reference is fixed by publishing the credential it names, through the
 *    panel. The broken row is not touched, and is asserted to be STILL false
 *    before the button is pressed. Without that middle assertion this journey
 *    would pass against a build where revalidate did nothing at all: the row
 *    would already have been true by the time it was read.
 *
 * 4. **The live check renders the answer the server gave.** `check` dials the
 *    provider and writes nothing, so its verdict is whatever the network says
 *    at that instant — it is asserted against the CAPTURED response body rather
 *    than against a fixed word, which would make this journey a test of whether
 *    a mock happens to be reachable.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE ONE STEP THAT IS NOT DRIVEN THROUGH THE UI, AND WHY
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Breaking the reference goes through the admin API. The provider FORM cannot
 * express it: `providerDataFor` (`src/pages/admin/llmProviderForm.ts`) emits a
 * flat `Record<string, string>` of the type's declared fields, and a credential
 * reference is a NESTED object — `{"ai_credentials": {"elitea_title": "…"}}` —
 * which the expander walks and fails to resolve. There is no control on this
 * screen that can author one, so authoring it by hand is the honest way to
 * reach the state; everything the panel CAN do (create, revalidate, check,
 * delete) is done by clicking. The state itself is not exotic: an operator
 * reaches it by renaming or deleting a credential another row names.
