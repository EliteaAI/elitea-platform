/**
 * The NESTED AGENT-AS-TOOL turn: a parent agent with a DIFFERENT child agent
 * attached, driven through a complete turn with that relation in place.
 *
 * `chat.agent-tools.spec.ts` attaches a relation, reads it back, and then
 * DETACHES it before its own chat step, saying in as many words that "an
 * agent-as-tool TURN is a separate journey this stack cannot run yet". This is
 * that journey. It is also the file that settles what that detach implies, and
 * the answer is narrower than it looks:
 *
 * ── WHY THAT FILE HAS TO DETACH, AND THIS ONE DOES NOT ────────────────────
 *
 * That spec attaches an agent to ITSELF (it has only one agent, so the
 * relation's parent and child are the same pair), and a self-referencing
 * relation really does refuse every send with 422
 * `unsupported_agent_execution` — measured. The cause is NOT the freeze
 * failing to build the reference, which is what "the freeze cannot build the
 * stored reference's shape" in that file's comment suggests; it is the
 * nesting walk. `walkCurrentApplicationNesting`
 * (`services/elitea-main/internal/infra/db/repos/agent_nesting.go`) carries a
 * cycle set keyed by `(application_id, version_id)`, and a parent that lists
 * itself repeats its own key one hop down: "circular reference to application
 * N version M".
 *
 * A DISTINCT child never repeats a key, so it is admitted — and this file
 * proves it, which is the whole point of authoring TWO agents. The refusal is
 * a property of the SELF-reference, not of the agent-as-tool feature. Anyone
 * reading that detach as "nested agents are refused" would be wrong, and would
 * have no test to correct them.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS PINS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. THE RELATION WRITE, IN THE DIRECTION THE UI SENDS IT. The URL names the
 *     CHILD (`.../application_relation/prompt_lib/{projectId}/{childAppId}/
 *     {childVersionId}` — the spec's own parameter names are
 *     `selected_application_id`/`selected_version_id`) and the BODY names the
 *     parent version being edited. Getting those two backwards writes a
 *     relation the other way round, which still answers 2xx.
 *
 *  2. THE PROJECTION THE FREEZE READS. The parent's version must come back
 *     carrying the child as an `application` tool whose settings hold the
 *     child pair. That projection is what
 *     `freezeCurrentStoredApplicationReference`
 *     (`services/elitea-main/internal/application/agentexecution/tools.go`)
 *     turns into the frozen reference, and it refuses on a surprising number
 *     of fields — a `name`/`toolkit_name` that disagree, a settings object
 *     with anything beyond the two identity keys, or a child `agent_type` that
 *     projects NULL because the stored `(application_id, version_id)` pair
 *     names no row. Every one of those is a 422 that says nothing about the
 *     child.
 *
 *  3. THE TURN IS ADMITTED WITH THE CHILD STILL ATTACHED. This is the
 *     assertion the detach in `chat.agent-tools.spec.ts` makes impossible
 *     there: the send happens with the relation IN PLACE, so the whole
 *     admission path — nesting walk, tier caps, freeze, projection — runs
 *     against a real parent/child pair.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ASSERTED: THE CHILD BEING CALLED ─────────────
 *
 * The nested invocation itself IS observable, and it was measured here — twice
 * — against the native Rust worker driven by a real tool-calling model:
 *
 *   worker: `agent.nested_application.invoke ... application_id=<child>
 *            version_id=<child version> outcome="succeeded"`, bracketed by
 *            `agent_tool_start`/`agent_tool_end` progress frames;
 *   store:  a `chat_message_trace_step` of kind `tool_call` whose `tool_name`
 *           is `elitea_agent_{applicationId}_v_{versionId}`
 *           (`services/elitea-worker-rust/src/agents/application_tools.rs`),
 *           readable from the browser over
 *           `GET /elitea_core/message_traces/prompt_lib/{projectId}/{conversationId}`.
 *
 * It is NOT asserted, because whether it happens is the MODEL's choice, and
 * the model this project runs against is not fixed. `chat-stream` is served by
 * `deploy/mock-llm/server.py`, which answers by echoing the prompt and emits a
 * tool call only for the prompt markers it implements — none of which is a
 * nested agent. So an assertion on the call would be green on a stack pointed
 * at a real model and red in continuous integration, for a reason that says
 * nothing about this feature. Measured directly: three consecutive runs of an
 * earlier draft that DID assert it went pass, pass, fail, and the failing run
 * was the one whose stored answer began `MOCK:`.
 *
 * That leaves this journey asserting ADMISSION with the child attached, which
 * is the half that regressed and the half that is deterministic. To check the
 * invocation by hand, point the stack at a tool-calling model and read the two
 * sources above; do not re-add a conditional assertion here, which would pass
 * by finding nothing on exactly the stack where it cannot find anything.
 *
 * The prompt below still names the child agent explicitly — the tool's
 * generated description carries the child's name ("Delegate a self-contained
 * task to the saved Elitea agent '<name>'"), which is the only handle a prompt
 * has on it — so that a manual run against a real model exercises the path
 * without editing the file.
 *
 * Lives in `streaming/` because a nested turn needs the full standalone stack
 * (`chat-stream` project, `scripts/chat-stream-e2e.sh`): the plain journeys
 * stack has no worker and no model.
