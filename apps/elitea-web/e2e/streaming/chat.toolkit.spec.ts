/**
 * A REAL TOOLKIT INVOCATION: an `openapi` toolkit authored in the toolkit
 * form, attached with the agent page's own "+ Toolkit" picker, and then
 * actually CALLED by the model inside a chat turn — with the proof taken
 * server-side rather than off the screen.
 *
 * Everything between the form and the call was unvalidated end to end. Each
 * half has unit coverage and each half is individually correct; what nothing
 * could see is the WIRING, which is where this repository's defects keep
 * landing (the "composition root" class). Four things had to hold at once and
 * only a browser driving the whole path can say whether they do:
 *
 *  1. the toolkit FORM has to store a specification the runtime can parse.
 *     `settings.selected_tools` is populated by the form as a side effect of
 *     parsing the pasted schema, so a toolkit created by POST carries whatever
 *     the caller typed and proves nothing about what a user gets;
 *  2. the PICKER has to write the agent↔toolkit mapping. It sends a PATCH that
 *     deliberately omits `selected_tools` (#248), a presence-sensitive
 *     distinction no hand-written request reproduces;
 *  3. the execution freeze has to hand the worker a toolkit it can
 *     MATERIALIZE. It did NOT, for the toolkit the form produces, and this
 *     journey is what measured it: the `openapi` schema the freeze reads
 *     declares an `openapi_configuration` credential reference, an anonymous
 *     API needs none, and `resolveConfigurationField` froze the absent field
 *     to an explicit JSON `null` — which the native worker's
 *     `merged_auth_settings` refuses, killing the whole TURN with
 *     `native_agent.invalid_configuration` and storing an empty assistant row
 *     flagged `is_error`. The freeze now writes `{}` there, the shape the
 *     Python SDK toolkit has always normalized a missing credential to
 *     (`settings.get('openapi_configuration') or {}`) and the one the native
 *     worker reads as "no auth". The journey therefore authors the toolkit
 *     PURELY in the form. The two-request workaround it used to carry — a
 *     fixture named `attachOpenApiConfiguration`, which created a credential
 *     by API and PUT the reference into the saved toolkit — is deleted, and
 *     deleting it is the point: a spec that hands the runtime a credential no
 *     user of an anonymous API would create cannot fail when that user's
 *     toolkit is the one that breaks;
 *  4. the runtime has to OFFER the operation to the model and DISPATCH the
 *     call the model makes.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THE ASSERTIONS ARE SHAPED THIS WAY
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A stored answer cannot carry this journey on its own. A turn whose toolkit
 * was dropped at assembly still answers, and answers in the same shape — the
 * mock echoes, the row is not flagged `is_error`, the screen looks identical.
 * So the load-bearing assertions are read out of the MOCK's two journals,
 * which are written by the server side of each hop:
 *
 *  - the MODEL journal's `tools` proves the toolkit MATERIALIZED: those are
 *    the function names the runtime put in the request. A toolkit that failed
 *    to materialize contributes none;
 *  - a second journal entry in `call_tool_resumed` mode proves the call was
 *    DISPATCHED and its RESULT fed back: the mock only takes that branch when
 *    the transcript already carries a `tool` message, which nothing but a
 *    real dispatch produces;
 *  - the TOOL journal proves the tool itself RAN. That last hop is asserted
 *    only where the worker can reach the mock — see `MockToolSpec.reachable`
 *    and the note at step 7, which states exactly what the native runtime's
 *    `https_only()` client can and cannot do here.
 *
 * WORKER: the native Rust runtime (`STANDALONE_WORKER=rust`). Every step below
 * was measured against it and none against the SDK worker, whose OpenAPI
 * toolkit accepts a different configuration shape (`http://` base URLs and
 * remote specification URLs, both of which the native runtime refuses). A leg
 * for that worker is a separate journey, not a wider skip here.
