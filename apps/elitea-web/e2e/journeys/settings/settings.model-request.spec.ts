/**
 * Settings › AI Configuration: "Request a model connection" files a real
 * moderation row against a real project, as the signed-in member.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS ADDS OVER `RequestModelConnection.test.tsx`
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * That unit test pins the WIRE exhaustively — the route, the `issue_type`, the
 * two-field body, the `provider:`/`model:` prefixes, the slashed-model-name
 * encoding, the per-field validation — against `msw`. Everything it asserts is
 * about what the browser SENDS.
 *
 * Three things it cannot say, and this journey does:
 *
 *  1. The control is REACHABLE. It renders on `/app/settings/model-configuration`
 *     beside the copy-configuration button, on a page that also has to have
 *     loaded seven per-section configuration queries before it mounts anything.
 *  2. The POST is AUTHORISED. `POST /admin/moderation_status/default/{p}/{e}`
 *     resolves `admin.moderation.create` against the caller's membership of the
 *     project; a mocked 201 proves nothing about that, and the button is
 *     deliberately not permission-gated in the UI, so a missing grant surfaces
 *     here and nowhere else.
 *  3. The row EXISTS afterwards. The read-back is the caller's own
 *     `GET /admin/moderation_status/default/{p}/{entity}`, which is scoped to
 *     the requester in SQL — the same call the App Catalogue's "Request Access"
 *     card reads, and the one whose pylon predecessor answered
 *     `{"status":"approved"}` to every caller for every entity. A POST that
 *     answered 201 and wrote nothing passes the unit test and fails this.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS RUN LEAVES BEHIND
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A moderation row cannot be deleted — the surface has a POST, a GET and a
 * decision PUT, and no DELETE at any mode (issue #544). So the row this file
 * files is DECIDED on the way out, by the admin persona, so the operator's
 * Pending tab ends the run as it started; `scripts/e2e-stack.sh seed` is the
 * only step with a database to remove the rows themselves.
