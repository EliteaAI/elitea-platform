/**
 * Journey 32: The admin Secrets page edits the GLOBAL vault — the right store —
 *             and its writes survive a reload (JRNY-032)
 *
 * ## Why this journey needs to exist at all
 *
 * Before unit A14 the `administration` mode of the secrets routes answered 501,
 * because every method on the project handler is keyed by the `{projectID}`
 * segment and admin_ui sends the placeholder `0` there — so serving this page
 * from it would have read and WRITTEN `project-0`'s vault. A journey that
 * asserted only "a table of secret names is present" would pass against exactly
 * that mistake, because a wrong-store read looks identical to a right-store one.
 *
 * So the assertions here are all against things only the correct store can
 * produce:
 *
 *  - The five `chat_max_*` entries are seeded by `scripts/e2e-stack.sh seed`
 *    into the `admin` vault ROW and into no other. They are Fernet blobs written
 *    as SQL literals, so they exist in no bundle and no fixture the client can
 *    reach; seeing them proves the page decrypted the global vault. Project 1's
 *    vault is seeded EMPTY, so a handler that fell back to a project row would
 *    render nothing at all.
 *  - The write is verified by a RELOAD and a re-read, not by the toast. A
 *    handler that answered 200 and wrote nothing is the defect #130/#180 shipped
 *    twice.
 *  - After the write, Settings › Secrets (the PROJECT vault, project 1) is
 *    checked and must still be empty. That is the store-separation assertion:
 *    the one failure mode the 501 existed to prevent, caught from the other end.
 *
 * The journey creates its own probe and deletes it again, so it is re-runnable
 * against a stack that was not re-seeded — and it never touches the five seeded
 * entries, which J20f depends on.
 *
 * No value used here is or resembles a credential.
