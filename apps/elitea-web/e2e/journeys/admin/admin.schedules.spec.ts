/**
 * Journey 33: The admin Schedules tab shows the platform cron table the
 *             scheduler actually runs, and its switch really flips a row
 *             (JRNY-033)
 *
 * ## Why this journey needs to exist at all
 *
 * Before unit A14 this page's PUT had no route, and its GET read something else
 * entirely: it queried the TENANT schema for application versions carrying
 * `meta->'trigger'`, hardcoded `enabled: true`, swallowed every error into an
 * empty list, and short-circuited on `projectID == "0"` — the only projectID the
 * admin page ever sends. A journey that asserted "a schedules table is present"
 * would have passed against all of that, because the table would have been
 * present and empty.
 *
 * So the assertions here are against things only a working server can produce:
 *
 *  - `e2e_schedule_probe_<engine>` is seeded into `centry.schedule` by
 *    `scripts/e2e-stack.sh seed` and exists in no bundle. Seeing it proves the
 *    listing reads that table — the one `services/elitea-scheduler` polls — and
 *    not trigger metadata.
 *  - It is seeded INACTIVE, and the page must render it inactive. The pre-A14
 *    handler could not represent that state at all.
 *  - The write is verified by a RELOAD and a re-read, never by the toast. A
 *    handler that answered 200 and wrote nothing is the exact defect #130/#180
 *    shipped twice.
 *  - `rpc_func` is asserted to be READ-ONLY. It names an internal platform RPC
 *    that runs unattended with full privilege and no caller identity, so the
 *    absence of an editor for it is a security property, not a layout detail.
 *  - The Tasks and Active Tasks tabs are asserted to state a REASON. They have
 *    no backend — they are Pylon/Arbiter runtime introspection — and an empty
 *    table there would read as "nothing is running".
 *
 * The journey restores what it changed, so it is re-runnable against a stack
 * that was not re-seeded.
