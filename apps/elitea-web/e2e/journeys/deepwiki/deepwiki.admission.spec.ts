 * DWIKI-013 — the provider is admitted at boot (ADR-0023 decision 6, H4a).
 *
 * Provider-backed, so it runs in the `deepwiki-stack` project only: the
 * standalone stack composes the facade with a public project
 * (ELITEA_AI_PROJECT_ID) and the Go host behind it, and the facade
 * registers the host's descriptor into the admission plane at boot and
 * keeps its health projection current. The E2E stack has no public project,
 * so registration is skipped there by design and this journey has nothing
 * to look at.
 *
 * What is asserted is the whole chain, from the ADMIN's side: the listing
 * the administration surface answers carries the provider the facade
 * registered — its own name from its own descriptor, the facade's target as
 * the origin, `healthy: true` from a probe inside the freshness window — and
 * the Service Descriptors page renders that row.

/**
 * DWIKI-013b — admission is IN FORCE: a revoked provider refuses invokes.
 *
 * DWIKI-013 above proves the plane RECORDS. This one proves it is READ: the
 * administration surface's one action — revoke — reaches the request path
 * and stops new work, which is what makes that surface an operator control
 * rather than an audit note. It pins the two things that must not drift: the
 * 503's stable `reason` code, and that a revocation is undone only by
 * admitting a new revision.
 *
 * `deepwiki-stack` only, for DWIKI-013's reason: nothing is registered on the
 * E2E stack, so the gate there resolves to "plane absent, allow" and there is
 * nothing to look at.
 *
 * THE REVOKE WINDOW IS SHARED STATE. While it is open every DeepWiki invoke
 * in the deployment is refused, DWIKI-005's generation included — and
 * `fullyParallel: false` orders tests WITHIN a file without pinning files to
 * one worker. The window is two polls wide and closed in a finally; run this
 * project with `--workers=1`.
 *
 * WHY THE REGISTRAR IS NOT WHAT RESTORES IT. The facade re-probes every
 * minute and that re-probe cannot lift a revocation, twice over: the
 * registrar short-circuits while the descriptor's name and digest are
 * unchanged (internal/providerhost/registrar), and even a forced write would
 * land on the SAME revision_id, whose upsert touches `reason` and
 * `admitted_at` and never `status`. A revocation is undone by admitting a NEW
 * revision — which is what the administration surface's POST does, and what
 * this test uses. The revoked row survives beside it, as audit.
