 * 250-254), the response of
 * `GET /api/v2/artifacts/objects/{projectID}/{bucket}`.
 *
 * They previously described the LEGACY Pylon plugin's `S3ObjectListResponse`
 * (`{name, contents:[{key,size,lastModified}]}`), an envelope elitea-main
 * never served — see issue #138.
 *
 * There is no dedicated `Artifact` schema server-side — an artifact IS an
 * object summary; `bucket` is not carried per-item and is attached by
 * `lib/normalise.ts` from the bucket the list was requested for.
