/**
 * User-visible action/entity-name copy ported from
 * apps/elitea-ui/src/common/constants.js (unit S3, spec §9.3).
 *
 * Every value in this file is user-visible copy. Per R-T3/N3 these should
 * ultimately flow through unit S8's `t()`/`shared/i18n/en.json` bundle
 * rather than live as plain TS constants — ported here verbatim (values
 * unchanged) only as a parity floor until S8 lands and Wave-2 feature units
 * have something to reference now. Not a recommendation to keep hand-written
 * string constants permanently; flagged once here rather than repeated
 * per-export.
