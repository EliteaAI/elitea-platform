/**
 * `version_details.llm_settings` — the model an agent or pipeline version
 * runs on, as its author picked it.
 *
 * Lives in `shared/api/` rather than in `entities/application-form` because
 * three layers need the same shape and none of them may import the others:
 * the draft (`entities/application-form/model/initialValues.ts`), the two
 * page mappers (`pages/agents/lib/`, `pages/pipelines/lib/`) and the model
 * picker that writes it (`widgets/`). `entities/application-form/index.ts`
 * is at the §3.5 slice-public-api cap (exactly 20 exports), so re-exporting
 * from there was not available even for the two layers allowed to reach it,
 * and `shared/` is the only layer everything above may import (R-L1,
 * `.dependency-cruiser.cjs:20-27`). `shared/` index budgets do not apply —
 * `isSliceIndex` in `scripts/lib/budgets-core.mjs` matches only
 * `features|entities|widgets|processes`.
 *
 * **Exactly these keys, and no others.** The Rust worker validates the
 * profile against a closed allow-list and refuses the whole turn with
 * `unsupported_profile` when it meets a key outside it
 * (`services/elitea-worker-rust/src/agents/assembly.rs`, `validate_model`).
 * Two keys that look available are deliberately absent:
 *
 * - `openai_compatible` — Configurations-owned. elitea-main deletes whatever
 *   the version carries and re-derives it from the project catalogue row
 *   (`services/elitea-main/internal/application/agentexecution/tools.go`,
 *   `resolveCurrentAgentModel`), so authoring it here can only ever be
 *   ignored or wrong.
 * - `top_p` / `top_k` — present in `api/openapi/v2.yaml` and therefore in
 *   the generated `LlmSettings` zod above, but NOT in the worker's
 *   allow-list. A version carrying `top_p` saves with a 200, freezes fine,
 *   and then fails at the worker on the first message. Do not surface a
 *   control for either.
 *
 * `reasoning_effort` IS modelled, because dropping it corrupts versions this
 * app did not author. The worker's `APPLICATION` allow-list carries it
 * (`assembly.rs`, `ModelFieldNames::APPLICATION`) and honours it, so a
 * version can legitimately hold one; before it was modelled here, seeding an
 * edit through `toAgentLlmSettings` stripped it and EVERY subsequent save
 * wrote the version back without it, silently moving a reasoning agent onto
 * the model's default effort. It is deliberately NOT in the generated
 * `LlmSettings` zod object — that is a closed `zod.object` with no such
 * field, and adding it needs a `v2.yaml` edit (its own PR — a spec edit trips
 * six separate CI gates). Nothing parses a write body through that schema at
 * runtime (`shared/api/generated/mutator.ts` hands the already-stringified
 * body straight to `eliteaFetch`), so the key reaches the wire today; until
 * the spec edit lands, {@link LlmSettingsBody} is the widened body type that
 * says so out loud rather than a cast at each call site.
