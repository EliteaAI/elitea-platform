/**
 * `useExecutionEvents` — the durable execution-replay SSE stream (issue #93).
 *
 * One Go route serves every long-running execution the runtime admits —
 * index ingest, agent chat, agent regeneration, configuration validation:
 *
 *   GET {vite_server_url}/executions/{projectId}/{executionId}/events
 *   (services/elitea-main/internal/api/router.go's `runtimeEventsPath`,
 *    handled by internal/api/v2/executions/events.go)
 *
 * The SSE `event:` name is the durable replay event type verbatim
 * (events.go writes `id: <cursor>\nevent: <type>\ndata: <json>`), and the
 * whole vocabulary is a closed set of five constants in the Go repos layer:
 *
 *   execution.node_event              infra/db/repos/node_events.go
 *   execution.failed                  infra/db/repos/{configuration_validation_results,command_outbox}.go
 *   execution.replay_reset            infra/db/repos/replay_events.go
 *   index.ingest.completed            infra/db/repos/index_ingest_results.go
 *   configuration.validation.completed infra/db/repos/configuration_validation_results.go
 *
 * DISCLOSED DEVIATION FROM ISSUE #93's TEXT: the issue names
 * `chat.stream.chunk`, `chat.stream.done` and an SSE `chat_message_sync`
 * for the chat surface. Those names exist in the legacy EliteaUI branch's
 * proof-of-concept, NOT in this repo's Go backend — grepping
 * `services/**` for them returns nothing, while agent execution is
 * explicitly routed through the SAME durable replay log as index ingest
 * (`node_events.go:197,543` gate on `agent.execute.application.v1` /
 * `agent.execute.adhoc.v1`). This module therefore implements the event
 * vocabulary the server actually emits. Add names here the day the backend
 * grows them.
 *
 * `execution.node_event`'s `data` is the bounded NodeEvent v1 JSON
 * (`services/elitea-worker-python/src/elitea_worker/protocol/node_event.py`
 * — thirteen fields: type, stream_id, message_id, question_id, content,
 * thinking, response_metadata, references, sio_event, created_at,
 * parent_message_id, agent_name, execution_generation). That is a superset
 * of `shared/api/socket/events.ts`'s `streamEnvelopeSchema` — the same
 * envelope the socket.io `chat_predict` receive path already carries — so
 * an SSE frame drops straight into the reducers the socket path feeds.
