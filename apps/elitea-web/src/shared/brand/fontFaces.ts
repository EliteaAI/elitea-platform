/**
 * `@font-face` generation from `pack.typography.fontFaces` (ADR-0024 WP3).
 *
 * The pack's `typography.fontFamily` names Montserrat, but until now nothing
 * declared where Montserrat comes from: there was no `@font-face` and no
 * font file, so every deployment silently fell through to the next family in
 * the stack. A pack now lists its self-hosted faces and this module turns
 * them into the one stylesheet the provider injects (`<style data-el-fonts>`,
 * `app/providers/BrandDocumentHead.tsx`).
 *
 * Same-origin ONLY (§3.7, theme-gate check 6): a face whose `url` is not a
 * root-relative or document-relative PATH is dropped and logged, never
 * emitted. That is the whole of this app's font-origin policy, enforced at
 * the one point a URL becomes CSS, so a served pack cannot reintroduce a
 * remote font host by stating one. Protocol-relative (`//host/...`), absolute
 * (`https://...`), `data:` and anything carrying characters that would end
 * the CSS `url()` token early are all rejected by the same predicate.
 *
 * `font-display: swap` on every face: the text paints in the fallback family
 * at once and re-paints when the face arrives. A brand font must never hold
 * first paint hostage.
