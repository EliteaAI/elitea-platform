/**
 * Pack scheme record -> MUI palette (spec §4.2 tier 2).
 *
 * Deviation from the §4.2 snippet, deliberate and total: the snippet calls
 * `toMuiPalette(pack.schemes.light, pack.brand)`. The scheme NAME is a third
 * argument because it is needed twice — to set `palette.mode` (MUI's own
 * light/dark component logic reads it, even with CSS variables on) and to
 * pick the scheme's reference ramp and brand anchor. Nothing else differs.
 *
 * `palette.error` and `palette.success` are not special-cased here: the
 * default pack carries them as ordinary token ids (`error.main`, …), so they
 * arrive through the same path as every other token and are white-labelable
 * like every other token. What §4.2 mandates is that they EXIST, and the
 * contract test asserts they resolve to pack values rather than MUI defaults.
 *
 * The single cast is the boundary between the pack's open token vocabulary
 * and MUI's closed `PaletteOptions` type; `tokens/palette.augment.d.ts`
 * types the READ side (`theme.vars.palette.*`) so component authors never
 * touch an `any`.
