 * See `./README.md` for the extraction convention Wave-2 units follow.
 *
 * `t(key, fallback)` is the ONLY way user-visible copy may appear in JSX
 * (R-T3, enforced live by `i18next/no-literal-string` in `.oxlintrc.json`),
 * and since issue #45 this barrel is the ONLY module that exports it — the
 * pre-S8 interim stub `src/shared/ui/lib/t.ts` was migrated away and
 * deleted. Do not narrow the two-required-argument shape; widening (as this
 * module already does with the optional third `options` argument) is safe.
