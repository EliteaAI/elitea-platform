 * Ported from `hooks/useBrowserPageTitle.js`'s `PageTitleSetter`
 * (reduced-scope notes: `../lib/pageTitle.ts`). Renders nothing.
 *
 * The brand pack's `product.name` is appended to every derived title. In the
 * old app the product name reached the browser exactly once — the static
 * `<title>Elitea</title>` in `index.html` — and the first route change
 * overwrote it, because `useBrowserPageTitle` composes titles from the
 * section and the project only. That is why JRNY-030 ("logo, primary colour
 * and product name come from the pack with no rebuild") had nothing
 * observable to assert on for the name: the one place it appeared was a
 * compiled-in literal that never survived navigation. Reading it from the
 * resolved pack here is what makes the name genuinely pack-driven, and the
 * suffix is the only visible change for a deployment on the default pack
 * (`… - Elitea`).
 *
 * `resolveBrandPack()` is memoised rather than called per render: it runs a
 * zod parse over the served pack, and the global it reads is fixed for the
 * document's lifetime (`index.html` sets it with a blocking script before the
 * bundle evaluates).
