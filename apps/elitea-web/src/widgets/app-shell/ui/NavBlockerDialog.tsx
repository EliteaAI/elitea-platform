/**
 * The navigation blocker (task brief: "a navigation blocker (unsaved-changes
 * guard)"). Ported from `components/UnsavedDialog.jsx`.
 *
 * TanStack Router's `useBlocker({ shouldBlockFn, withResolver: true })`
 * (verified against the installed `@tanstack/react-router@1.170.18`
 * typings, `useBlocker.d.ts`) is a strictly more robust replacement for the
 * old app's react-router `useBlocker` + `BLOCK_NAV_PATTERNS`
 * path-allowlist: it fires for EVERY navigation attempt through the router
 * (including `widgets/sidebar`'s `<Link>` clicks and
 * `widgets/create-button`'s `navigate()` calls) with no per-call-site
 * wiring needed, so `SidebarBody`'s old per-click `navigateToPage` special
 * case (SHELL-011's "defers API cache reset" half — see `widgets/sidebar`'s
 * header) does not need re-implementing here.
 *
 * `BLOCK_NAV_PATTERNS` (the old app's path-allowlist — only certain routes
 * are "blockable") is NOT reproduced: no landed Wave-2 unit owns an editor
 * page yet, so there is no path list to allowlist against. `shouldBlockFn`
 * therefore blocks on `isBlockNav || isStreaming` alone, for ANY
 * navigation — the safe default once a real editor sets those flags
 * (blocking too broadly is the fail-safe direction; the old app's
 * allowlist existed to avoid blocking on genuinely safe pages, which today
 * never set the flags in the first place, so the allowlist has no
 * observable effect yet either way).
 *
 * `UnsavedDialog.jsx`'s `blockerFn` DOES reproduce one piece exactly,
 * though: it only blocks when `currentLocation.pathname !==
 * nextLocation.pathname` — a same-pathname navigation (e.g. a search-param
 * update on the route the user is already on) is explicitly let through
 * even while blockable/streaming. TanStack Router's `shouldBlockFn` args
 * (`ShouldBlockFnArgs`, `useBlocker.d.ts`) carry `current`/`next` each with
 * their own `pathname`, so that same pathname-equality check applies here
 * unchanged — this is live today via `processes/chat/model/
 * useStreamingNavBlocker.ts` setting `isStreaming` on the real `/chat`
 * route, which declares several search-only params.

   * `getState()` — the LIVE store snapshot — not the `isBlockNav`/
   * `isStreaming` values selected above (#133).
   *
   * `shouldBlockFn` is invoked by the router at navigation time, but a
   * closure over the selected values can only ever see the values from the
   * last COMMITTED render. That is stale exactly when it matters: an editor
   * that lowers the flag and navigates in the same event handler (a
   * successful save — `pages/pipelines/CreatePipeline.tsx`, `pages/agents/
   * CreateApplication.tsx`) sets the store and calls `navigate()` before
   * React has re-rendered this component, so the closure still said "block"
   * and the page's own post-save navigation was blocked by a prompt about
   * changes it had just persisted. Measured: J16 (`pipelines.lifecycle.spec.ts`)
   * timed out on `waitForURL(/\/app\/pipelines\/latest\/\d+/)` the moment
   * the create page started arming the guard.
   *
   * Reading the store here is strictly more correct for every caller —
   * including the chat-embedded editors, which had the same latent
   * staleness — because the question "is there unsaved work RIGHT NOW" can
   * only be answered at the instant the navigation is attempted.
   *
   * The same reasoning applies to `enableBeforeUnload` below. The selected
   * values above still drive the dialog's own render (`warningMessage`) and
   * the `beforeunload` listener, which do need to re-render on change.

     * Measured on a live deployment: on a freshly loaded /app/toolkits,
     * `window.dispatchEvent(new Event('beforeunload', {cancelable: true}))`
