 * `vi.stubGlobal`, which leaks across files in the same worker: a test that
 * needed the stub but did not install it passed locally — because a file that
 * DID install it happened to run first in that worker — and failed in CI, where
 * the shard split put it in a worker on its own. `EditApplication.test.tsx` hit
 * exactly that after it began rendering `CreateAgentForm`.
 *
 * Installing it here makes the environment deterministic instead of dependent
 * on file ordering. Per-file `vi.stubGlobal` calls still override this.

 * because mermaid measures every label to lay a diagram out.
 *
 * Installed here for the same reason as `ResizeObserver` above: this is a
 * browser API jsdom lacks, not application behaviour, so stubbing it is the
 * environment's job and not a test's (`elitea/no-vi-mock`, R-M1, bans reaching
 * for `vi.mock` to paper over it). The numbers are a fixed, non-zero box — real
 * layout is what a browser gives you, and the `storybook` vitest project runs in
 * a real Chromium when that matters. What these polyfills buy the `node`
 * project is the ability to tell "rendered" apart from "threw", which is exactly
 * what the MermaidDiagram tests assert.
