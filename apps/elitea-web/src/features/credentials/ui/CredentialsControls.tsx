/**
 * ui/CredentialsControls.tsx — the kebab-menu control cluster on a
 * credential's edit screen: Delete (with typed confirmation). Ported from
 * `apps/elitea-ui/src/[fsd]/features/credentials/ui/credentials-tab-bar/CredentialsControls.jsx`.
 * Manifest COPY-114, PERM-021.
 *
 * DISCLOSED SCOPE REDUCTION (forced by ownership boundary, see this unit's
 * final report): the baseline's Pin/unpin menu item
 * (`widgets/pin-toggler`'s `usePin`/`usePinMenu`) is dropped — that widget
 * slice is cross-domain and out of this unit's ownership fence (R-L1:
 * `features/credentials` may not import `widgets/pin-toggler`). Only
 * Delete is ported. Permission gating (`checkPermission(PERMISSIONS
 * .configuration.delete)`) and the "last remaining vectorstorage/embedding
 * config" guard are both caller-computed (`canDelete`/`deleteDisabledReason`)
 * rather than read from a `useCheckPermission()`/RTK-Query hook this slice
 * has no access to yet — see `../lib` for the permission-string constants
 * (`@/shared/lib/permissions`) a caller wires this from.
 *
 * The `Tooltip`+`Box`-wrapper around `menu` is rendered UNCONDITIONALLY
 * (only its `title` prop varies via `resolveTooltipTitle`) rather than
 * branching between a wrapped and a bare tree. `canDelete` is caller-derived
 * and, for protected-section credentials, can legitimately flip after mount
 * (see `pages/credentials/useCredentialDeleteGuard.ts`) — branching the tree
 * shape on it would make React's type-based reconciliation unmount and
 * remount `<ControlsDropdown>` on every flip, wiping its open-menu state.
 * MUI's `Tooltip` no-ops on an empty `title`, so this costs nothing when
 * there is nothing to disclose.
