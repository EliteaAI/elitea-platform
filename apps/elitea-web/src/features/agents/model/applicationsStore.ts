/**
 * Port of `apps/elitea-ui/src/slices/applications.js` — the baseline's
 * Redux `applications` slice. This app has no Redux (`@reduxjs/toolkit` is
 * not a dependency — see `package.json`); `zustand` is the established
 * substitute (`widgets/app-shell/model/navBlocker.store.ts`,
 * `widgets/sidebar/model/sidebarCollapsed.store.ts`,
 * `features/credentials/model/useCredentialValidation.ts`).
 *
 * **What ported, and why only 3 of the baseline's 6 state slots:**
 *
 * - `isSaving`, `shouldRefetchDetails`, `versionValidationInfo` — genuine
 *   cross-component CLIENT state with no other home. `isSaving` is
 *   `dispatch(appActions.setIsSaving(isSaving))`'d by the baseline's
 *   `useSaveVersion.js:182-185` on every render (consumed elsewhere in the
 *   old app, outside this unit's owned files, by whatever renders a global
 *   "saving…" indicator); `versionValidationInfo` is written by
 *   `useValidateApplicationVersion.js`'s `extractValidationInfo` and read by
 *   its own `useToolsValidationInfo`/`useToolValidationInfo` (both owned by
 *   this unit — ported onto this store in `useValidateApplicationVersion.ts`).
 *
 * - `currentApplication`, `toolkitSchemas`, `mcpSchemas`,
 *   `configurationsAsSchema` — the baseline's `extraReducers` block
 *   (`slices/applications.js:37-89`), which mirrors 4 RTK Query
 *   `matchFulfilled` payloads into this slice purely so components could
 *   read them via `useSelector` instead of the query hook directly. TanStack
 *   Query removes the reason for that mirror entirely: any component that
 *   needs `applicationDetails`/`toolkitTypes`/`getAvailableConfigurationsType`
 *   data calls the real generated query hook for it directly (the cache IS
 *   the store) — mirroring it into a SECOND, hand-synchronised store would
 *   be duplicate, driftable state with no benefit. Not ported; no consumer
 *   inside this unit's owned files reads any of the 4 (confirmed by reading
 *   every owned file in full — `useCreateConfiguration.jsx` takes
 *   `configurationsAsSchema` as a caller-supplied PARAMETER, not from this
 *   slice, so the accumulation reducer has no consumer to preserve either).
 *
 * Lazy-singleton factory pattern (R-S2: "No store may be created at module
 * scope in a file that is also imported by `app/`") — see
 * `widgets/app-shell/model/navBlocker.store.ts`'s header for the full
 * rationale; mirrored verbatim here.
