 * duplicated logic" spirit the C2 brief applies elsewhere). No baseline
 * equivalent: the old app's hooks are untyped JS operating on whatever
 * shape the caller happened to hold in React state.
 *
 * **Judgment call, disclosed:** the baseline's `folders`/`dateGroups`/
 * `pinnedConversations` arrays hold FULL conversation records (`name`,
 * `folder_id`, `isPinned`, timestamps, …) — richer than `entities/folder`'s
 * own `FolderConversationRef`, which is deliberately minimal (that type
 * models exactly what the folders-LIST wire response gives per its own
 * module doc: `id`/`updatedAt`/`createdAt`/`isPlayback` only). `entities/
 * conversation`'s `Conversation` is a structural superset of
 * `FolderConversationRef` (same 4 fields, plus everything else these hooks'
 * callers actually need — `name`, `folderId`, `isPinned`, …), so every
 * conversations-array element in THIS feature's state trees is typed as
 * `Conversation` rather than `FolderConversationRef`.
