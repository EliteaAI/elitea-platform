/**
 * Response wiring slice of `./useToolkitChat.hooks.ts`. Carries BOTH live
 * transports for the toolkit/index run:
 *
 *  - SSE (issue #93, preferred): once `./useToolkitChat.hooks.ts`'s REST
 *    start call returns a `task_id`, `useExecutionEvents` follows that
 *    execution's durable event stream. `execution.node_event` frames are
 *    the same NodeEvent v1 envelope the socket carried, so they go through
 *    the SAME `generateChatMessageBasedOnResponse` reducer;
 *    `index.ingest.completed` and `execution.failed` are the terminal
 *    frames the socket path had no distinct equivalent for.
 *  - socket.io (fallback): the original `chat_predict` response listener
 *    and `chat_enter_room`/`chat_leave_rooms` room lifecycle, kept intact
 *    for backends that answer the start call without a `task_id`. Baseline
 *    citation `useToolkitChat.hooks.js:180-226`; see the
 *    `mcp_authorization_required`/`useSocketRoom` deviation rationale in
 *    `./useToolkitChat.hooks.ts`.
 *
 * The two never double-drive the reducer in practice: the SSE stream only
 * opens when an `executionId` exists, and that only happens on the REST
 * path, which does not emit `chat_predict`. Both remain wired
 * unconditionally because a run started before a backend upgrade must keep
 * streaming on the transport it started on.
 *
 * TWO issue #310 fixes live in `handleNodeEvent`/the `useExecutionEvents`
 * wiring below:
 *
 *  - MESSAGE-ID CORRELATION: `handleNodeEvent` used to forward any
 *    `execution.node_event` frame with a `type` straight to the reducer,
 *    regardless of which run's `message_id` it carried. `trackedMessageIdRef`
 *    locks onto the first frame's `message_id` for the run currently
 *    following `executionId`, and `isFrameForCurrentIndexExecution`
 *    (`../../indexes/lib/helpers/indexExecution.helpers.ts`) drops any later
 *    frame that names a DIFFERENT one — a stray frame from another run must
 *    not corrupt this run's transcript.
 *  - ONE-SHOT FALLBACK: `onStreamError` used to fire `runSocketFallback`
 *    (start the run over socket.io) on ANY stream error, including one that
 *    arrives long after the stream genuinely opened and had already been
 *    carrying real frames — a network blip or a backgrounded tab would
 *    re-dispatch the SAME run a second time. `hasStreamOpenedRef`
 *    (set from the `open` event `useEventSource.ts` now exposes) makes
 *    `onStreamError` a no-op once the stream has opened at least once; only
 *    an error BEFORE any successful open still means "this task_id was not
 *    a real Go execution" and falls back.
 *
 * Both refs are reset whenever `executionId` changes, so a fresh run is
 * never gated by the PREVIOUS run's state.

 * `index.ingest.completed`'s `status` -> this app's `IndexStatuses`.
 *
 * Server side, `indexReplayData` (`services/elitea-main/internal/infra/db/
 * repos/index_ingest_results.go:613-645`) writes ONE OF TWO SHAPES, and they
 * mean different things:
 *
 *  - the SUMMARY shape, `{status, message}`, whose `status` is the closed set
 *    `ok` | `partly_indexed` | `error` (`internal/application/output/
 *    index_ingest.go:118-122`);
 *  - the ARTIFACT shape, `{artifact_id, immutable_version, media_type,
 *    byte_length, digest, classification}`, which carries NO `status` key —
 *    the reference type has no outcome field at all, and the projection only
 *    writes it after `IndexIngestResult.Validate()` and artifact verification
 *    have both passed.
 *
 * The two are therefore treated differently, where a single `default:` used
 * to treat them the same:
 *
 *  - An artifact-shaped frame keeps settling as `completed`. It is a verified
 *    terminal projection and there is nothing in it to read an outcome out of;
 *    inventing a failure here would be as much of a guess as the old code's
 *    success.
 *  - A frame that DOES carry a `status` but not one of the three known values
 *    now settles as `failed`, not `completed`. That branch is the real defect
 *    the old `default:` hid: an unrecognised terminal status is not a success
 *    claim, and `completed` is in `RUNNABLE_INDEX_STATUSES` — so the old
 *    mapping did not merely paint the wrong colour, it advertised the index as
 *    searchable on the strength of a status this build has never seen.
