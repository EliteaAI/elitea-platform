 * Index-execution admission helpers (issue #310).
 *
 * `../../lib/hooks/useToolkitChatDispatch.hooks.ts`'s `startToolRun` used to
 * treat EVERY `startIndexExecution` failure the same way: swallow it in a
 * bare `catch {}` and fall through to the socket.io `chat_predict` emit. A
 * `409 "Indexing is already in progress for this index"` is not a failure
 * to retry around — it is the Go handler
 * (`services/elitea-main/internal/api/v2/indexing/start_handler.go`'s
 * `writeStartError`, `ActiveIndexConflictError` branch) reporting that a run
 * for this index is ALREADY admitted, and naming its `task_id`. Falling
 * through started a SECOND run: duplicate work, double billing, and (since
 * the error was swallowed) no test could observe it.
 *
 * Ported from the legacy branch's `indexExecution.helpers.js`
 * (`EliteaAI/EliteaUI@feat/replatform-index-sse-pov-main-sync`) —
 * `isBoundedIndexExecutionTaskId`, `parseIndexStartConflictTaskId` and
 * `canStartToolkitRun` only. The rest of that file
 * (`buildPendingIndexExecutionKey`/`findAuthoritativeActiveIndex`/
 * `sameIndexExecution`/`resolveAuthoritativeIndexExecutionTaskId`/session-
 * storage reattach) backs a fuller "reattach on reload" flow issue #310
 * explicitly scopes OUT (see its "Done means" — that flow is not one of the
 * five listed behaviours), and depends on machinery (`refetchIndexesList`
 * returning the fresh list synchronously, an `onActiveIndexReattach`
 * confirmation callback) this app's port of the hook does not carry. Not
 * ported here.
