/**
 * DEFECT, fixed here: this file used to hash a catalogue key into a number
 * with FNV-1a (`entityIdForType`) before sending it as `entity_id`.
 *
 * The hash existed because `v2.yaml` typed the `entity_id` path parameter as
 * an integer. That integer type is a leftover from a retired static stub. The
 * generated client therefore demanded a number. The column is a VARCHAR and the handler stores
 * the raw string (`internal/api/v2/moderation/requests.go`), and the legacy
 * EliteaUI sends the key itself ("inventory"). One catalogue entry therefore
 * had two addresses: a request filed here was invisible in the other client
 * and filed a second row, and the admin App Requests queue listed an opaque
 * number. The spec now types the parameter as a string, so the key travels
 * unchanged.

 * caller's own rows, newest first, and `ModerationRequestList` in the spec
 * now says so. Until A14 the Go side answered a bare `{"status":"approved"}`
 * from a static stub, which was the only shape this function used to read.
 * Against a real server it found no `status` field and fell through to
 * `NONE`. The "Pending approval" state on a catalogue card was therefore
 * unreachable. The card would keep offering "Request Access" after the
 * request had been filed.
 *
 * The bare-object branch stays because a hybrid deployment can still be served
 * by a pylon that returns the create response's shape from the POST path this
 * hook optimistically reads back.
