/**
 * The publish surface as ONE component: the two toolbar controls, the dialog
 * behind them, the unpublish confirmation, and the error seam for the actions
 * that happen with no dialog open.
 *
 * The editor page used to hold all three pieces — the hook, the buttons' props
 * and the modal — and thread them together itself. That put a three-part
 * protocol in a page whose subject is editing a skill, and it put four more
 * symbols across the slice boundary for no gain: a caller has no decision to
 * make between "run the hook" and "render the dialog", so there was nothing for
 * it to compose.
 *
 * `permissions` is passed IN rather than read here. The permission set comes
 * from `widgets/sidebar`, and a feature reaching into a widget is the wrong
 * direction — the same layering rule `pages/agents/lib/isPublicAgentsProject.ts`
 * documents for `routes/`.
