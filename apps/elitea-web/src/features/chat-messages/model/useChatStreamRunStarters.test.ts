/**
 * useChatStreamRunStarters.test.ts — the fallback decision, as a value.
 *
 * `useChatStreamTransport.test.tsx` already drives both ends of this module
 * through real HTTP (msw) and a real stream: a 400 falls back, a 422 keeps its
 * server sentence, a 200 with no `events_url` falls back. What it cannot reach
 * from there is the rest of the classification table — an `auth` failure, a
 * network failure, an abort, a 405, an error that is not an `EliteaApiError`
 * at all — because those need a transport that fails in a way msw does not
 * model. That table is the whole contract (fall back to the socket, or tell
 * the user the server refused), so it is asserted directly here.
