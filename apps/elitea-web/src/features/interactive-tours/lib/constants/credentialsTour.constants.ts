Instead of entering API keys or passwords each time you configure a toolkit, you store them once as a credential and reference that credential by name wherever it is needed.

Credentials are reusable across multiple toolkits and projects, and they can be kept private or shared with team members.`,

- **ID** — a unique internal name used to link this credential to toolkits; auto-generated from the Display Name but can be edited
- **Display Name** — a short, human-friendly label shown in credential lists and toolkit selection dropdowns
- **Type-specific fields** — the actual authentication data required by the chosen service; varies by integration type and may include API keys, server URLs, usernames and passwords, OAuth client IDs and secrets, or discovery endpoints; required fields are marked and must be filled before saving`,
