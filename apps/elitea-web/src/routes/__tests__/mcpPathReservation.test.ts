/**
 * Guards a path namespace this app SHARES with the backend.
 *
 * `/app/<numeric project id>/<rest>` is this app's project-switch deep link
 * (`src/routes/$projectId.$.tsx` — the `$projectId` param with a `$` splat).
 * It is also, since issue 252, the shape of the MCP SERVER endpoint that
 * `services/elitea-main` serves: `deploy/traefik/dynamic.yml` and
 * `dynamic.e2e.yml` both carry a router matching
 * `^/app/[0-9]+/mcp(/.*)?$` at priority 100, which wins over this app's
 * `PathPrefix(/app)` rule and sends those requests to elitea-main.
 *
 * So the first URL segment `mcp` — exactly `mcp`, followed by `/` or nothing —
 * is RESERVED. Today nothing collides: the routes here are `mcps/...` (plural)
 * and `mcp-auth-callback`, and neither matches. But the overlap is invisible
 * from either side, and the failure it produces does not look like a routing
 * bug: a deep link to a singular `/mcp` route would leave the browser holding
 * elitea-main's `{"error":{"message":"missing authorization header"}}` with a
 * 401, because it sent a session cookie to a JSON API that does not accept
 * cookies for HTML. No E2E journey would catch it either — the same traefik
 * rule is in the E2E stack's config.
 *
 * Hence this test. It reads `parity/route-wiring-map.json`, whose route list is
 * re-derived from `src/routes/**` and gated in CI (`gate-route-wiring-map`), so
 * a new route cannot be added without passing through here.
 *
 * If a singular `/mcp` route is genuinely wanted, the fix is to narrow the
 * traefik rule (and the `/app/{project_id}/mcp` path in
 * `services/elitea-main/api/openapi/v2.yaml`'s MCP section) FIRST — not to
 * delete this assertion.
