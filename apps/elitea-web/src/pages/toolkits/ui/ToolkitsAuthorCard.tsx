/**
 * The `rightPanelExtra` slot `features/toolkits`' `ToolkitsList` leaves for
 * a page-level caller — filled with the real author card
 * (`shared/ui/EntityRail`), the baseline's `AuthorInformation` in
 * `RightInfoPanel.jsx:44-48`.
 *
 * A page-owned component rather than an inline block in `Toolkits.tsx`:
 * that file is 3 lines under the §3.5 400-line budget, and this decision
 * (personal-project predicate + which pathname keys the statistic) is a
 * self-contained unit worth naming. `/toolkits` renders `Toolkits:
 * total_toolkits`; `/mcps` matches no entry in the baseline's own
 * `ROUTE_STATISTIC_MAP`, so the card shows the author with no statistic
 * row — the same nothing the baseline renders there.
 *
 * Renders `null` when the viewer is not looking at their own personal
 * project. "Trending Authors" is deliberately NOT the fallback here: the
 * toolkits/MCP routes carry no `author_id`, so there is no author scope for
 * the baseline's other branch to be about.
