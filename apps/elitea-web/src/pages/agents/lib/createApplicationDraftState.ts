 * cover. Held as separate local state rather than widening the RHF form's
 * generic type: `zodResolver(applicationCreationSchema)` is typed as
 * `Resolver<ApplicationCreationInput>`, and stretching the form's type param

 * **Disclosed gap:** `features/agents/ui/CreateAgentForm.tsx` takes no

 * has no such field, and `GeneralFields`' `StyledInputEnhancer` calls pass no
 * `error`/`helperText`), so a mapped field error cannot be rendered literally
 * under the Name/Description inputs from the page alone. This still closes the
