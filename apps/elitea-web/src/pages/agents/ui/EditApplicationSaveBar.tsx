 * instance and renders the provider, so it sits ABOVE that provider in the

 * hook's real home in the baseline, where `ApplicationTabBar` — a sibling
 * component, for exactly the same reason — is its only caller.
 *
 * Moved out of `EditApplication.tsx` (which sat at 399 of the §3.5 400-line
 * budget) to make room for the model picker, alongside the two components
 * that page already keeps in this directory.
