 * `buildAvailableConfigurationsTypeUrl` then emitted
 * `/configurations/available/?` with an empty query, and the server answers
 * an empty section list with EVERY section: 49 descriptors, 136,007 bytes,
 * uncompressed and with no `Cache-Control` or `ETag`. The size is the smaller
 * half of the damage. `CredentialForm` hands `availableTypes.data` straight to
 * `<CredentialTypeSelector>`, so the Create Credential picker also listed the
 * 17 non-credential types — `llm_model`, `embedding_model`, `s3`, `pgvector`,
 * `service_prompt`, `environment_settings`, `project_icon`, `project_context`
 * and the six `ai_credentials` providers. None of them carries a `hidden`
 * flag, so nothing downstream filtered them out.
 *
 * On edit the descriptor is found by `detail.data.type`, whose section can be
 * any of them. That path waits for the detail, then asks for that one
 * section.
 *
 * SECOND DEFECT this repairs. The first repair returned an empty section
 * list for an edit whose detail names no section. An empty list disabled the
 * query for ever, so the descriptor never resolved and the form showed no
 * schema field. Save stayed enabled, so the person could save an empty body.
 * `services/elitea-main/internal/api/v2/configurations/dto.go:20` always
 * emits the key, but the value can be empty. This path now reads the
 * unfiltered catalogue instead. It costs one large response on a rare row,
 * and it keeps the form usable.
