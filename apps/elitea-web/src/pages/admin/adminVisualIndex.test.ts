/**
 * The drift gate between the admin ROUTER and the visual-coverage index
 * (issue #229).
 *
 * `parity/screenshot-index.json` carried no `/admin/app/*` row at all, and
 * `scripts/check-visual-coverage.mjs` enforces only the routes that index knows
 * about — so the visual gate could not fail for an admin screen. Not "did not":
 * *could not*, for any change, ever. #225 added persistent navigation to all ten
 * admin pages and altered zero snapshots, with both `Visual regression` and
 * `check-visual-coverage` green.
 *
 * Adding the ten rows fixes today. This test is what stops it happening again:
 * the legal set is read out of `createAdminRouter()`'s OWN table, exactly as
 * `AdminNav.test.tsx` reads it for the nav. A hand-written list here would go
 * stale the first time somebody added an admin page, and the failure mode is
 * silent — a new page simply has no row, so the coverage gate never asks for a
 * spec and reports a green tick for a surface it cannot see.
 *
 * Both directions are asserted, because each catches a different mistake:
 *  - a route with no index row  → a new admin page that nothing would ever gate
 *  - an index row with no route → a row kept alive after its page was deleted,
 *    which the coverage gate would then demand a spec for forever
