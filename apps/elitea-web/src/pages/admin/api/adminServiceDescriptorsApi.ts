/**
 * REST client for the admin SERVICE DESCRIPTORS surface — unit A14, issue #200.
 *
 * THREE calls: the listing, activate and deactivate.
 *
 * ## The "answers 501" prose that used to be here was stale, and is gone
 *
 * This file used to say the surface refuses, that no mutation was declared
 * because "there is nothing to delete", and that the listing is "expected to
 * FAIL with 501 on this platform". None of that has been true since migration
 * 0107 gave the admission plane a store: the listing answers 200 from tables,
 * registration records a revision, and DELETE revokes one. Migration 0109 adds
 * the policy overlay that lets a revision be ACTIVATED, which is what the two
 * mutations below call.
 *
 * The 501 path still exists and is still read: a deployment that has not applied
 * 0107 or 0109 has no admission plane, and the page renders the server's own
 * sentence for it. What changed is that 501 is now the exception rather than the
 * whole story — which is exactly why the prose had to go. A comment describing a
 * refusal that no longer happens is the "disclosed gap" shape this repository
 * has been bitten by: it reads as current, and nothing fails when it stops being
 * true.
 *
 * The reference client (`admin_ui`'s `serviceDescriptorsApi.js`) declares a
 * delete, and this file still does not: DELETE revokes rather than removes, it is
 * terminal, and no page control issues it yet. Deactivate is the recoverable
 * verb and is what the table offers.
 *
 * Not generated: `orval` builds from `v2.yaml`, which does not describe the
 * admin-panel routes. Handwritten in the same shape as `./adminConfigurationApi.ts`.
 *
 * The wire contract mirrors the Go handler in
 * `services/elitea-main/internal/api/v2/eliteacore/service_descriptors.go`, which
 * keeps pylon's path and mode (`legacy/plugins/elitea_core/api/v2/admin.py`) so
 * the existing admin_ui client reaches the same endpoint unchanged — and now gets
 * the same honest 501 rather than three invented rows.
 *
 * ## What is reused
 *
 * `unwrapBody` (added by the Users port) and `configFailureReason` /
 * `configFailureStatus` from `./adminConfigurationApi`. Those two readers are
 * exactly this page's need — it renders the server's own sentence and has to tell
 * 501 from a load failure — and re-deriving them here would be a second copy to
 * drift. Nothing else: a different endpoint and its own query-key namespace.
