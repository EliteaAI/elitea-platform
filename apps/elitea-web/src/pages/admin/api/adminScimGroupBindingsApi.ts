/**
 * REST client for the SCIM GROUP BINDINGS.
 *
 * A binding is the authored half of a SCIM group push. A SCIM group carries a
 * name and a member list; membership on this platform is always (user, project,
 * role). The binding says which project and which role, so the identity
 * provider supplies only the members — it cannot choose a project, cannot
 * choose a role, and cannot create or delete either.
 *
 * Wire contract: `services/elitea-main/internal/api/v2/admin/scim_group_bindings.go`.
 *
 *   GET    /admin/scim_group_bindings/administration
 *   GET    /admin/scim_group_bindings/administration/project_roles/{projectID}
 *   POST   /admin/scim_group_bindings/administration
 *   PUT    /admin/scim_group_bindings/administration/{id}
 *   DELETE /admin/scim_group_bindings/administration/{id}
 *
 * Not generated: `orval` builds from `v2.yaml`, which does not describe the
 * admin-panel routes. Handwritten in the shape of `./adminIdentityProvidersApi.ts`
 * and reusing its failure reader rather than restating it.
 *
 * ## `id` is a string here, as it is on the SCIM resource
 *
 * The server renders it as a string on both surfaces, so this screen and an
 * identity provider address the same binding the same way. It is never parsed
 * into a number: a JSON number round-trips through a float.
