/**
 * REST client for the admin CONFIGURATION surface — unit A14, issue #200.
 *
 * Three calls: the section list, one section's values, and the save. The
 * reference client (`admin_ui`'s `configurationApi.js`) declares fifteen; the
 * other twelve drive Pylon runtime administration — plugin reload, remote plugin
 * YAML, plugin updates, pylon log tailing, maintenance splash — and there is
 * nothing here to call. They are not declared in this module at all, and the
 * sections that would have used them render the server's own reason instead.
 * See `../Configuration.tsx`.
 *
 * Not generated: `orval` builds from `v2.yaml`, which does not describe the
 * admin-panel routes. Handwritten in the same shape as `./adminSchedulesApi.ts`.
 *
 * The wire contract mirrors the Go handler in
 * `services/elitea-main/internal/api/v2/admin/config_values.go`, which in turn
 * keeps pylon's path, modes and body keys
 * (`legacy/plugins/admin/api/v2/plugin_config_values.py`) so the existing
 * admin_ui client speaks to the same endpoint unchanged.
 *
 * ## What is reused
 *
 * `EliteaApiError`/`eliteaFetch` and the failure-reason reader pattern from
 * `./adminSchedulesApi.ts`. Nothing else: a different endpoint, a different
 * payload shape, its own query-key namespace.
