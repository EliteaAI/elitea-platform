/**
 * REST client for the admin SCHEDULES surface — unit A14, issue #200.
 *
 * One read and one write, both real. The reference page (`admin_ui`'s
 * `SchedulesTasksPage`) has five reads and five mutations; the other four of
 * each belong to its Tasks and Active Tasks tabs, which are Pylon/Arbiter
 * runtime introspection with no endpoint to call here. They are not declared in
 * this module at all — see `../SchedulesTasks.tsx` for why those tabs render
 * unavailable instead.
 *
 * Not generated: `orval` builds from `v2.yaml`, which does not describe the
 * admin-panel routes. Handwritten in the same shape as `./adminProjectsApi.ts`.
 *
 * The wire contract mirrors the Go handler in
 * `services/elitea-main/internal/api/v2/scheduling/schedules.go`, which in turn
 * mirrors the pylon original (`legacy/plugins/scheduling/api/v2/schedules.py`)
 * the existing admin_ui client already speaks to — same path, same body keys,
 * same row fields. The trailing `0` in the URL is pylon's `projectID` segment;
 * administration mode ignores it and every client sends `0`.
 *
 * ## What is reused
 *
 * Nothing textual from the four pages before this one — a different endpoint,
 * a different row shape, its own query-key namespace. The schedule HISTORY
 * drawer is a different story: it runs entirely on `./adminAuditApi`'s
 * `useAuditSpans`, unchanged, because a schedule's execution history IS audit
 * events of type `schedule` (`SYSTEM_EVENT_TYPES` there already names it).

/**

 * It matters more here than on a listing page: this write is refused for
 * several DIFFERENT reasons the operator can act on — an unparseable cron, a
 * name longer than the column, an attempt to change what the schedule runs —
 * and rendering "Failed to save" over all of them would hide the only sentence
 * that says which.
 *
 * A 401 does NOT arrive here, and that is the shared client's decision, not an
 * oversight: `shared/api/http.ts` routes it into the single-flight re-auth path
 * and reports `kind: 'auth'`, which carries no body. Those render the generic
 * notice. Only `kind: 'http'` — 4xx and 5xx that are not an auth challenge —
 * can explain itself, and since issue 93 that INCLUDES a 403: an authorization
 * refusal is not a session failure, so it keeps its body.
 *
 * The `kind !== 'http'` line below is TYPE narrowing and documentation, not a
 * behavioural guard: no other failure variant has a `body` field, so deleting it
 * changes nothing observable. Mutation testing confirms that (mutant M15
 * survives, and is equivalent). It stays because removing it would make the
 * `failure.body` access a type error, and because the next reader needs to know
 * that an auth refusal is deliberately unexplained here.
