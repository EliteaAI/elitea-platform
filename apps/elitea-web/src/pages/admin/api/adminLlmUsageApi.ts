/**
 * REST client for the admin LLM Proxy section's **Usage** tab —
 * `GET /api/v2/admin/gateway/usage`.
 *
 * ## What this restores
 *
 * LiteLLM's admin UI had a Usage page. ADR-0015 replaced LiteLLM with
 * `services/elitea-llm-gateway` and nothing replaced that page: migration 0084's
 * header records the gap in its own words — the budget accumulator holds money
 * per (scope, scope_id, period) and nothing else, so "the port of that page has a
 * meter and nothing else". `gateway.llm_usage_events`, the per-request ledger
 * 0084 added, is what this reads.
 *
 * ## A separate file from `./adminLlmProxyApi`, and a separate query namespace
 *
 * Usage is a REPORT over requests that have already been billed. A price
 * override changes what the NEXT call costs and never what a past one did, so
 * the catalogue's mutations deliberately do NOT invalidate this key: refetching
 * here after a save would redraw an unchanged screen and imply the edit had
 * reached the history.
 *
 * Not generated: `orval` builds from `v2.yaml`, which does not describe the
 * admin-panel routes.
