/**
 * REST client for project CREATE and DELETE — the front half of the
 * provisioning pipeline (#333).
 *
 * Split from `./adminProjectsApi.ts`, which owns the listing and the three
 * writes that came with the original port of this page. The split is not
 * arbitrary: these two are the only writes on the page that do NOT belong to
 * the `/admin/...` family. Creation and deletion belong to the projects handler
 * (`services/elitea-main/internal/api/v2/projects/create.go`), which drives
 * `internal/application/projectprovisioning` — ordered steps forward, and the
 * same steps compensated in reverse when one fails.
 *
 * That is why both carry STEP LISTS rather than a bare ok. A provisioning
 * failure is a position in a pipeline, not a status code, and the position is
 * the part an operator can act on.
 *
 * The cache key namespace is imported rather than redeclared: a second one here
 * would be a cache these writes never refresh, which is the read/write key split
 * that made saved data look absent in #132.

 * listing refetch before issuing the next DELETE — N round trips of dead time
 * on top of N schema drops, with the dialog's "will be destroyed" list visibly
