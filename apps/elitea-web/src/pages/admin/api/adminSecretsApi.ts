/**
 * REST client for the GLOBAL secret vault — the admin Secrets surface (unit A14).
 *
 * ## This is NOT the project vault, and the two must not be confused
 *
 * `entities/secret/api/secretApi.ts` addresses `…/secrets/{secrets,secret}/default/{projectID}`:
 * ONE project's vault, row `project-<id>` in `centry.secrets_data`. This module
 * addresses the `administration` mode of the same routes, which pylon maps to a
 * different handler over a different row — `admin` — whose contents are merged
 * into EVERY project's `{{secret.…}}` resolution
 * (`EngineBase.get_all_secrets` folds in the global vault as `shared_secrets`).
 *
 * They therefore share no endpoint, no body shape and no query key:
 *
 * | | project (`default`) | global (`administration`) |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | list | `[{name, secret_name, is_default}]` | `[{name, secret: "******"}]` |
 * | read one | `{name, secret_name, value, is_hidden}` | `{secret: "<value>"｜null}` |
 * | create | `POST …/secrets/default/{id}` `{name, value}` | `POST …/secret/administration/0/{name}` `{secret}` |
 * | update | `PUT …/secret/default/{id}/{name}` `{name, value}` | `PUT …/secret/administration/0/{name}` `{secret:{old_name, value}}` |
 *
 * The `0` in every administration path is a PLACEHOLDER. Pylon's admin handlers
 * take a `project_id` parameter and ignore it entirely, and admin_ui has always
 * sent `0`; `services/elitea-main/internal/api/v2/secrets/admin.go` ignores it
 * the same way. It is kept because the route shape is pylon's and inventing a
 * different one is what #137 cost.
 *
 * Not generated: `orval` builds from `v2.yaml`, which does not describe the
 * admin-panel routes. Handwritten in the same shape as `./adminUsersApi`.
 *
 * ## Values never enter the query cache
 *
 * `useRevealAdminSecret` is a MUTATION, not a query, even though it is a GET.
 * A query would park plaintext credentials in the TanStack cache, keyed and
 * retained, where every devtools panel and every later `getQueryData` can reach
 * them. The reveal is a one-shot fetch whose result the caller holds for as long
 * as the operator keeps the row open and no longer.

/**
 * The server's own explanation of a refusal, when it gave one.
 *
 * The refusals this surface produces are specific and actionable, and a generic
 * "Failed to…" would throw all of them away:
 *
 *   - `400 {"message":"Secret \"x\" already exists"}` — the create the page's own
 *     duplicate check did not catch, because the listing was stale.
 *   - `400 {"message":"secret name must contain only letters, digits and
 *     underscores"}` — the server's copy of the name rule.
 *   - `404 {"message":"Project secret was not found"}` — an edit of a secret
 *     something else deleted in between.
 *   - `500 {"message":"global vault is unreadable"}` — the vault rows exist and
 *     cannot be opened, which is a deployment fault (a wrong `SECRETS_MASTER_KEY`
 *     is the usual cause) and NOT an empty vault. The handler distinguishes the
 *     two deliberately: reporting "no secrets" here would invite a write that
 *     replaced the vault.
 *
 * A 403 is NOT among them: `shared/api/http.ts` escalates 401 AND 403 into the
 * re-auth flow, and that branch (`failure.kind === 'auth'`) carries no body. So a
 * caller refused for lack of `configuration.secrets.secret.view` — a real state,
 * since the administration-mode `editor` role holds every write permission on
 * secrets and not that one — gets the re-auth path and then the generic message,
 * not a sentence naming the permission. Changing that means changing the shared
 * client's 403 policy, which is out of this unit's scope.
