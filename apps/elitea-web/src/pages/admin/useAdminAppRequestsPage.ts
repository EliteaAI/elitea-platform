/**
 * State, data and write handlers for `pages/admin/AppRequests.tsx` (unit A14).
 *
 * Split out of the page for the same reason `useAdminProjectsPage` is: the page
 * component stays a render, and the branching that decides WHICH controls exist
 * lives in one place.
 *
 * ## Paging, sorting and filtering are SERVER-side here
 *
 * The opposite call from `useAdminSchedulesPage`, and for a reason that is about
 * the table rather than about taste: `centry.moderation_state` grows with every
 * user who ever asked for anything, across every tenant, while
 * `centry.schedule` is a platform table with tens of rows. The endpoint pages in
 * pylon and in the Go handler alike, so the page that pages must also let the
 * server sort — a client-side sort over one page reorders that page only, which
 * reads as a working sort and is not one.
 *
 * ## The issue-type filter
 *
 * The queue is issue-type-agnostic by design (any client may `POST` any
 * `issue_type` label — `internal/api/v2/moderation/requests.go`'s header),
 * so unlike `status` there is no enum to draw options from. Two consequences:
 *
 *  - The filter's OPTIONS come from a second, separate query
 *    (`issueTypeOptionsQuery` below) that asks for a sample of rows across
 *    every status with no `issueType` filter of its own. Deriving them from
 *    `listQuery`'s rows instead would be self-defeating: the moment an
 *    operator picks a type, that query narrows to ONLY that type, and the
 *    option list built from its rows would collapse to the one thing already
 *    selected — an operator could select a type but never discover another.
 *  - That sample is bounded (the server caps `limit` at 100), so on a queue
 *    with more distinct issue-type labels than fit in the most recent 100
 *    rows, an old or rare label may not appear as an option. The active
 *    filter value is always unioned back in, so a deep link naming one still
 *    selects correctly even when the sample does not happen to contain it.
 *
 * ## Deep-linking is a plain URL read/replace, not TanStack Router's search API
 *
 * That machinery exists (`useSearch({ strict: false })` / `useNavigate()`,
 * as `pages/settings/Users.tsx` uses for `inviteUsers`), but its convention
 * in this app — stated in `features/agents/model/useAgentEditorUrlSync.ts`'s
 * header — is that a route's search params are owned by that route's OWN
 * generated `Route` object. `pages/admin/router.tsx` declares no
 * `validateSearch` for any of its eleven routes, a fact
 * `__tests__/testRouter.tsx` states outright and relies on by not mounting a
 * router at all. Wiring this one page into that machinery would mean adding
 * `validateSearch` to `appRequestsRoute` and mounting a router in its tests —
 * a change to the route tree, out of this filter's scope. Reading/writing
 * `window.location` directly gets the same shareable-link outcome (the URL
 * carries the filter, a reload restores it) without it.
