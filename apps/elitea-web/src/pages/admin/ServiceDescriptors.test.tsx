/**
 * Rendering and behaviour tests for `pages/admin/ServiceDescriptors.tsx` (unit A14).
 *
 * This page is deliberately unavailable, so "it renders" is close to worthless as
 * a bar. Each test asserts one of the properties that make the unavailability
 * honest rather than decorative:
 *
 *  - the sentence shown is the SERVER's, not one the page carries — the test
 *    serves a reason no source file contains and expects to see it;
 *  - a 501 and a 500 are told apart, so a broken server cannot pass itself off as
 *    a considered architectural decision;
 *  - if the server ever answers 200 WITH ROWS, the page shows them and drops the
 *    notice. That is the assertion that would catch someone wiring the endpoint
 *    to a stub, which is the failure this whole unit exists to remove;
 *  - the REQUEST is the one pylon serves — the right path, the right mode, and
 *    GET only. No registration verb is ever issued, because no control exists to
 *    issue one.
