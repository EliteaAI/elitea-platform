/**
 * Create/delete state for the admin Projects page — the front half of the
 * provisioning pipeline (#333).
 *
 * Separate from `./useAdminProjectsPage` rather than folded into it, for the
 * reason that hook's own header gives about the page component: these two
 * controls carry more state than the other five writes combined (a selection, a
 * dialog each, an in-flight flag each, a step list, and a per-project failure
 * list from a loop), and none of it is shared with the listing. Merging them
 * would put the page's paging state and its destructive path in one reducer.
 *
 * ## Selection is cleared whenever the listing changes
 *
 * Ids are the whole of the selection, and the rows behind them come from ONE
 * page of ONE tab of ONE search. Keeping a selection across a tab change would
 * arm the delete dialog with ids whose rows are no longer on screen — the
 * operator would confirm a list they cannot see. `clearSelection` is called from
 * every control that changes which rows are listed.
 *
 * ## The delete loop
 *
 * There is no batch route: the page sends one DELETE per project and collects
 * the failures. It runs SEQUENTIALLY, not with `Promise.all`, because each call
 * drops a schema and runs a migration-ledger cleanup against the same database;
 * firing five at once buys nothing an operator can perceive and makes a partial
 * failure harder to attribute.
