/**
 * The LLM Proxy Usage tab.
 *
 * The report itself is arithmetic and needs no defending. What is asserted here
 * is the part that can be wrong while looking right:
 *
 *  1. **A section that FAILED never renders as a section with nothing in it.**
 *     "No spend" is the reassuring reading of an empty table, and it is the one
 *     an operator would act on. The server answers with a per-section error for
 *     that reason; this proves the panel shows each one where its table would
 *     have been, and that the three working tables are still rendered beside it.
 *  2. **Sub-cent spend is not rounded to the same string as zero.** An
 *     uncatalogued audio model bills zero and no budget can stop it, so "$0.0000"
 *     and "billed nothing" must not be the same cell.
 *  3. **A partial body does not take the panel down with it.** The totals are
 *     formatted with `toFixed`, which throws on undefined, and the crash would
 *     unmount the very alert carrying the server's explanation — so the last
 *     case below sends a body with an empty `totals` object on purpose.
 *  4. **The member breakdown's omission is disclosed.** Calls with no resolvable
 *     member are counted in the totals and in the project breakdown but under no
 *     member, so the two do not sum — and a reader who is not told that will
 *     conclude the numbers are wrong, or worse, will not notice.
