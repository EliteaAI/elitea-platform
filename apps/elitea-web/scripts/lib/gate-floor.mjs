/**
 * gate-floor.mjs — the shared "the subject set is not empty" rule (issue #528).
 *
 * A gate reads a subject set and reports the offences in it. When that set is
 * EMPTY, the gate finds no offence and exits 0. Absence then reads as
 * correctness: nobody can tell "the gate looked at 3164 modules and liked them
 * all" apart from "the gate looked at nothing". Both print the same tick.
 *
 * Eight gate scripts had that hole. Nine others already state a count and fail
 * below it — `check-handlers.mjs`, `check-fixture-freshness.mjs`,
 * `check-budgets.mjs`, `theme-gate.mjs`, `check-bundle-secrets.mjs`,
 * `check-partition.mjs`, `check-ci-dormancy.mjs`, `check-bundle-budget.mjs`
 * and `check-mutator-coverage.mjs`. This module is that same line, written
 * once, so every caller states its numbers in the same words.
 *
 * TWO RULES, and the second one matters as much as the first:
 *
 *   1. Fail below the floor. An empty or implausibly small subject set is a
 *      broken gate, not a clean tree.
 *   2. PRINT the count on the pass path too. A reader must see WHAT the gate
 *      measured, not only that it measured something. A floor nobody reads
 *      goes stale in silence.
 *
 * A floor is a plausibility bar, not a target. Set it well under today's
 * number, so ordinary work never trips it, and well over zero, so a subject
 * set that collapses does.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: counts in, decision out. The callers own the
 * printing and the exit code, because `process.exit` inside a rule module
 * cannot be tested.
