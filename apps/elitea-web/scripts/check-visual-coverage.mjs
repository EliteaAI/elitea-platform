/**
 * Reports how much of `parity/screenshot-index.json` the `@visual` suite
 * actually covers, and fails when a route the index marks `wiringStatus: wired`
 * has no spec.
 *
 * Why this exists: the `visual` job passing says "no snapshot changed". It says
 * nothing about how many screens have a snapshot at all. Without this, 5 covered
 * routes and 29 covered routes produce the identical green tick — and the whole
 * point of the surrounding effort is that a green gate must not imply coverage
 * it does not have.
 *
 * Only `wired` is enforced. A route still marked `ready`/`needs-route-state`/
 * `blocked-codegen`/`hybrid-defect` renders scaffolding, and a baseline of
 * scaffolding is worse than no baseline: it makes the stub the official
 * reference and goes green forever after.
 *
 * A REFUSAL IS NOT SCAFFOLDING (issue #229). Several admin screens render
 * "unavailable, and here is why" and nothing else — Service Descriptors
 * entirely, and every one of Configuration's twelve sections. Those ARE
 * baselined, deliberately, and the distinction is not a loophole: scaffolding is
 * unfinished UI whose eventual screen is meant to look different, so pinning it
 * freezes the wrong thing; a server-declared refusal is the FINISHED screen, and
 * pinning it is what makes the regression visible if someone later wires the
 * endpoint to a stub that answers 200. Both pages render the SERVER's sentence
 * rather than a copy they carry, which is why the baseline moves when the server
 * changes its answer. Contrast `/help-center` in the EXEMPT map below: there the
 * content is MISSING (nothing has been configured), not refused, so a baseline
 * would pin an unconfigured tenant rather than a decision.

  ['/chat/:conversationId', 'not snapshotted — needs a deterministic conversation list, NOT a missing backend. POST /api/v2/elitea_core/conversations/prompt_lib/1 was verified returning 201 against the running stack; the route renders (chat.tsx supplies ChatWithEditors + <Outlet/>, so the child\'s `component: () => null` is by design). The obstacle is that seeding a conversation per run grows the sidebar list, so the snapshot would differ every time. It is now closer to tractable: the sidebar is mounted (#128) and /chat\'s own landmark ("Still no conversations created.") is the empty branch of that very list, so a seed producing a FIXED conversation set unblocks all four shots.'],

  // — but for a NARROWER reason since the admin Configuration port (#200).
  //
  // `useResourcesConfig` used to make no request at all, because the endpoint
  // behind it returned chat and upload limits rather than resource links. It
  // now reads `GET /admin/plugin_config_values/prompt_lib/resources`, which
  // serves the section an administrator edits on Admin > Configuration >
  // Resources, and journey 36g asserts that round trip end to end.
  //
  // What is left is a SEEDING question rather than a wiring one, which is the
  // same shape as `/chat/:conversationId` above: this stack configures no
  // resource links, so the cards still render "No links configured" and a
  // baseline would still make an unconfigured screen the official reference.
  // Seed a fixed set of links and the route becomes coverable.
  // Issue #229. Every other admin route got a baseline in that change; this one
  // is the single exception and the reason is determinism, not wiring — the page
  // reads the database and renders it correctly.
  //
  // The obstacle is that EVERY visible value on this screen is a function of the
  // wall clock at seed time, so a baseline taken against one stack cannot match
  // a stack seeded at a different time of day — which is every other stack,
  // including every CI run. Both DateRangeFields render today's date; the Time
  // column is second-resolution local time; and the heatmap's column geometry
  // and per-cell alpha are computed from where the four seeded rows fall inside
  // the range (`cellAlpha` re-scales every cell against the grid's max, so
  // nothing about that chart is stable).
  //
  // WHICH day it is no longer belongs on that list. #214 pinned one timezone for
  // the browser and the seed, and journey 29 freezes its clock to the day the
  // fixture was written on, so the `Today` window and the rows agree by
  // construction. That fixes correctness, not stability: the rows still land at
  // whatever minute the seed ran, which is what a baseline cannot survive.
  //
  // Masking is not a way out: what would have to be masked is the entire content
  // area, which is the whole page. What WOULD unblock it is a fixture at a fixed
  // absolute timestamp — journey 29's frozen clock is half of that already —
  // read through a deterministic range.

WHICH day is no longer part of it — #214 pinned one timezone for browser and seed and froze journey 29 to the seeded day — but the rows still land at whatever minute the seed ran, so a baseline could only ever match the stack that produced it.
