# router over the real llmproxy handler, with no provider and no database), then
# runs conformance.py against it with the INSTALLED elitea_sdk.

# ── What this measures that nothing else does ────────────────────────────────
#
# Tier 1 (scripts/contract/test_sdk_budget_contract.py) compares the SDK source
# with the gateway source. It cannot see a defect that both sources agree on and
# the wire does not: a route that 404s, a body the client library reshapes, a
# stream whose usage trailer is dropped. Tier 3 (deploy/scripts/sdk-client-check
# .sh) drives a whole stack, but that stack has no budget enforcement, so its
# refusal arm is a negative control only. This tier is the one that produces a
# REAL 402 from the REAL gateway code and hands it to the REAL SDK reader.
#
# ── The pin is checked before anything runs ──────────────────────────────────
#
# internal/sdkpin/sdk-pin.json states the SDK revision the gateway's
# compatibility gates were verified against. This script refuses to run against
# any other revision: a green result about the wrong revision is worse than no
# result, and "the checkout happened to be something else" is exactly the shape
# this repository keeps mistaking for a pass.
#
# IDENTITY AND CONTENT ARE TWO CHECKS (#567). The revision below answers WHICH
# commit is checked out. It does not answer WHAT the working tree holds: a dirty
# tree keeps the pinned HEAD, and `git rev-parse` walks UP to an enclosing
# repository, so a hand-authored directory inside a pinned clone reports the
# pinned revision too. verify_pinned_content.py then compares the bytes of every
# file the gates read against the digests the pin records.
