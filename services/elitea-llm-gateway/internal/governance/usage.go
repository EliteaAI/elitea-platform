// usage.go — the read-only budget-consumption view the authored-governance
// plane needs for the CEL `budget_used` variable (internal/policy).
//
// It is deliberately NOT part of CheckBudget. CheckBudget is an admission
// decision with a fail-mode FSM behind it; this is an observation, it is
// consulted before dispatch on a request that has not been admitted yet, and it
// must never refuse anything. Keeping them apart stops a routing rule from
// acquiring the power to block a request through the back door.

// BudgetFraction returns the fraction of the project's ceiling consumed in the
// current period, and whether a ceiling exists to divide by.
//
// ok is false — and the caller renders 0 — when the project is unlimited, has
// no budget row, or the snapshot cannot be read. A routing rule must not fail a
// request, so every unreadable state resolves to "nothing consumed" rather than
// to an error. That direction is safe here BECAUSE this value only ever selects
// a route: the spend control is CheckBudget, which fails closed on the same
// unreadable snapshot.
//
// The returned value is a float64 and is the ONLY float on this path. It is a
// RATIO, not money: both operands stay int64 nano-USD and the division happens
// once, at the boundary, to produce a CEL input. No money value is derived back
// out of it.
