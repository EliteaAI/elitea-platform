// This file holds ONE test, and it is the only place the gateway's budget
// refusal is read the way elitea-sdk reads it.
//
// Every other budget test asserts the two wire fields directly. That proves the
// gateway writes what this repository decided to write. It does not prove the
// SDK can act on it, and for four months it could not: the member refusal put
// the scope in error.type, the SDK matches error.type against "budget_exceeded"
// alone, and so `budget_exceeded_from` returned None for every member-cap
// refusal. Nothing failed. The gateway wrote a correct-looking 402, the SDK
// raised no typed exception, and the refusal reached the model as content.
//
// So this test does not assert field values. It ports the SDK's reader and asks
// it the question the SDK asks: is this a budget refusal, and whose budget?
//
// Keep sdkBudgetScopeFrom a TRANSCRIPTION of
// elitea-sdk/elitea_sdk/runtime/exceptions.py::budget_exceeded_from. When that
// function changes, change this one, and let the test say what broke.

// sdkBudgetScopes mirrors elitea-sdk's BUDGET_SCOPES tuple.

// sdkBudgetScopeFrom is the Go transcription of the SDK's reader. It returns
// the scope the SDK would attach to its BudgetExceededError, or "" when the SDK
// would NOT classify the body as a budget refusal at all.
//
// The two SDK behaviours that matter, both reproduced here:
//
//   - the match is on error.type and on nothing else. The SDK's dict branch
//     returns None when the type does not match; it does not fall through to
//     the message-text path;
//   - an unrecognised error.code resolves to DEFAULT_BUDGET_SCOPE, which is the
//     project scope.
