// budget_member_alert_test.go — the member soft alert (issue #510).
//
// The defect: #321 gave the gateway a per-member ceiling that refuses a call
// with 402 `member_budget_exceeded`, and the soft-alert path stayed
// project-scoped. A project crossed its threshold and an alert went out; a
// member crossed the same threshold and nothing did, so the refusal was the
// first signal that a cap applied to that member at all.
//
// Both directions are asserted against the same handler and the same fake,
// with only the member's post-increment state differing. Without the "below"
// case, a path that alerted on EVERY billed request would pass the crossing
// test.
