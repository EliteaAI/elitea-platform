// budget_member_test.go — per-member budget admission and billing (issue #321).
//
// The defect these cover: gateway.user_budget was authored, served and
// rendered, and the gateway's admission check knew a single project scope, so a
// member cap never refused anything. A test that only proves the refusal would
// not have caught it either — a gate that refuses EVERY member also passes
// "over-cap member is refused". Both directions are asserted here, against the
// same handler and the same fake, with only the member's verdict differing.
