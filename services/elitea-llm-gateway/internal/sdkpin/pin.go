// Package sdkpin carries the gateway's declared relationship to elitea-sdk.
//
// The /llm surface has one first-class client. Its budget reader decides what a
// correct 402 body looks like, and its two base paths decide which routes must
// exist. The gateway used to declare no relationship to it, so an SDK bump
// could not fail a gateway gate — which is how the budget-scope defect shipped.
//
// The pinned revision itself belongs to
// services/elitea-worker-python/elitea-sdk.lock.json. This package holds the
// SEPARATE statement that the gateway's compatibility gates were run against
// that revision and passed. pin_test.go compares the two, so moving the SDK
// turns the gateway test job red with no gateway source change.
//
// The pin states CONTENT as well as identity (#567). A revision names which
// commit is checked out; it says nothing about what the working tree holds. The
// two compatibility gates read `git rev-parse HEAD` and stopped there, so a
// dirty checkout kept the pinned HEAD and a green run could mint a pin for
// bytes nobody measured. VerifiedAgainst.Contents records the sha256 of every
// SDK file those gates read, and both gates hash the checkout against it.
