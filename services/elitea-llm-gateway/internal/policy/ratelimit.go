// Limiter enforces authored per-minute rate limits against a shared counter.
//
// # Two semantics worth being explicit about
//
// REQUESTS are counted on arrival: the limiter increments first and refuses if
// the new total exceeds the ceiling. A refused request therefore still counts
// toward its window. That is the standard fixed-window behaviour and it is
// self-limiting — a caller hammering a closed window keeps it closed, which is
// the intent — but it does mean the observed count can exceed the ceiling.
//
// TOKENS cannot be counted on arrival, because the token cost of a request is
// unknown until the provider answers. The limiter therefore READS the window's
// token total at admission and refuses when it has already reached the ceiling,
// then adds the actual usage after the completion. The consequence, stated
// plainly: a token ceiling is enforced on the request AFTER the one that
// crossed it, so a single very large request can overshoot by its own size.
// There is no way to do better without pre-tokenising every request in the
// gateway, which would put a tokeniser for every provider dialect on the hot
// path.
//
// # When the counter is unavailable
//
// The limiter FAILS OPEN, loudly. A rate limit is a protection against
// overload, not a billing control: refusing all traffic because the counter is
// unreachable converts a NATS outage into a total outage, and the budget gate
// — which IS the spend control — has its own fail-mode FSM for exactly that
// decision. Every fail-open is counted in Degraded() and logged, so the gap is
// measurable rather than assumed.
