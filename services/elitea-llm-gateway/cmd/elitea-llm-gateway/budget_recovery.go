// budget_recovery.go — issue #315: budget enforcement comes back when NATS
// becomes reachable.
//
// Issue #304 made the failure VISIBLE: a gateway that starts while NATS is
// unreachable reports not ready instead of serving unmetered. It did not make
// the gateway RECOVER. server.New dials once, and nats.go only resurrects a
// connection that succeeded at least once, so a failed initial dial left
// enforcement off until an operator restarted the pod — which they can only do
// after NATS is back.
//
// Two things had to become safe before recovery could be written:
//
//  1. The gate itself. It was a plain field the money path read with no
//     synchronisation, so installing it late was a data race on billing.
//     llmproxy publishes it atomically now (internal/llmproxy/budget_plane.go).
//  2. The governance store. /readyz reads it on request goroutines and the
//     shutdown path reads it on the main goroutine, so a late write to a plain
//     variable is the same hazard one layer up. enforcementPlane below is the
//     atomic holder for it.
