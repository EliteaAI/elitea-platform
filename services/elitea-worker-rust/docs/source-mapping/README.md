# Source-to-Rust mapping

These ledgers map observable Elitea behavior to concrete Rust ownership. They
are compatibility evidence, not a byte-for-byte port plan.

The evidence has three equal, complementary implementation sources:

1. the current platform Python worker owns the executable interpretation of the
   language-neutral protobuf contracts, control/output gRPC lifecycle,
   `NodeEventV1` bridge, result/artifact binding, delivery fencing, spool replay
   and settlement;
2. `elitea-sdk` owns most agent, configuration, toolkit and indexing business
   behavior;
3. Centry `indexer_worker` owns current application/ad-hoc invocation,
   continuation, callback, orchestration, indexing and UI-compatibility behavior.

The `.proto` files are the schema authority, but schema inspection alone is not
enough: the Python worker's validators, lifecycle code and tests define how the
contract is safely executed today.

Source snapshot used for the initial reconstruction inventory:

| Source | Revision |
| --- | --- |
| `elitea-platform` language-neutral contracts and Python worker | `4a553cee4302c863a562232f1b6b9964d5237357` |
| `elitea-sdk` | `fd6c01be2afcc696cce68b430fa1d89ddba3ae21` |
| Centry `indexer_worker` | `67d65b0dbbb8dbe2d590e8ecfe8ec13cd96998fa` |

Every implementation slice must update its rows in the same commit. Status has
one of these meanings:

- `planned`: target ownership is proposed, but the Rust file does not yet
  exist;
- `foundation`: the file exists and proves only the behavior named in the row;
- `partial`: some observable behavior is implemented, with missing gates listed;
- `blocked`: the current language-neutral or cross-service contract cannot
  express or consume the behavior end to end;
- `ported`: all named behavior, policy, error, cancellation, and differential
  tests pass;
- `intentional deviation`: Rust deliberately improves or retires an
  implementation detail while preserving the documented product contract.

A row is never `ported` based only on compilation or final-answer similarity.
The proof must cover the relevant wire shape, state transition, event ordering,
authorization, failure behavior, and recovery boundary.

Workspace-relative Python paths are included because the Python sources live in
independent repositories. The Rust targets all live in this package and are
repository-relative to `services/elitea-worker-rust/`.
