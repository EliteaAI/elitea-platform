Phase 4 — Cluster-Based Structure Planner

Converts pre-computed math clusters (Phases 1-3) into a full
``WikiStructureSpec`` with cheap LLM naming calls.

**Batched naming** eliminates "centroid bleed" by naming pages from their
own symbols and deriving each section name from those page names in the same
LLM call. The legacy two-pass section/page naming flow remains as fallback.
