// Package pricesync implements the LLM model price-catalog sync worker
// (design §8.8). It runs as a cold, low-frequency batch job inside
// elitea-scheduler (which already has a pgxpool and a ticker loop, so it is off
// the /llm hot path) and keeps gateway.gateway_models — the per-1M-token price
// catalog — refreshed from one or more ordered PriceSource adapters.
//
// THE LOAD-BEARING INVARIANT (§7.1/§8.8): gateway.gateway_models stores prices
// PER 1,000,000 BILLED UNITS. Upstream feeds (LiteLLM, getbifrost.ai/datasheet)
// publish prices PER SINGLE UNIT. The Normalizer below is the SINGLE conversion
// point that multiplies per-unit → per-1M by ×1,000,000. Feeding a per-unit
// value straight into the per-1M schema is a silent 1,000,000× undercharge;
// skipping or duplicating this multiply anywhere else re-opens the bug. Every
// source declares its own Denomination and the Normalizer applies exactly one
// convert.
//
// The billed unit is a TOKEN for a chat model, a SECOND of audio for
// speech-to-text, and a CHARACTER for text-to-speech. All three ride the same
// conversion, because the denomination is a COUNT and the count scale is the
// same for all of them. They are stored in separate columns, because a price
// per second must never be multiplied by a token count.

// Denomination is the BILLED-UNIT COUNT a PriceSource publishes prices against.
// It is not specific to tokens. A model bills against one of three units — a
// token (chat), a second of audio (speech-to-text), or a character of text
// (text-to-speech) — and every upstream feed publishes ALL THREE at the same
// count per price. LiteLLM, for example, publishes input_cost_per_token,
// input_cost_per_second and input_cost_per_character all as the cost of ONE
// unit, so one PerToken declaration scales all three correctly.
//
// Read the names below as "per single unit", "per 1,000 units", "per 1,000,000
// units". A reader who reads them as tokens-only will think the audio columns
// need a second, separate conversion; they do not, and adding one would be a
// 1,000,000x overcharge on every audio row.
//
// The zero value is deliberately invalid so a source that forgets to declare one
// fails loudly rather than defaulting to a wrong (and silently mis-scaled) unit.
