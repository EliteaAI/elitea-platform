// Package budgetwriteback implements the JetStream write-behind consumer
// (design §8.6): the durable pull consumer "budget-writeback" that drains the
// GATEWAY_BUDGET_DELTAS stream and lazily persists budget deltas into
// gateway.llm_budget_accumulators, keeping the Postgres durable tier
// seconds-fresh for the tiered-hybrid fallback (§8.5).
//
// Placement (design §8.6): the consumer lives in elitea-scheduler, which
// already has a pgxpool and a running loop. A durable pull consumer gives
// natural multi-consumer safety; a single active consumer is sufficient at the
// scale-1 baseline.
//
// This package owns ONLY the write-back drain path. The recovery-reconciliation
// goroutine (§8.5) and the outage-window direct-write path stay in the gateway;
// the two writers touch DISJOINT accumulator rows (write-back:
// NOT (outage_mode AND NOT reconciled); reconciliation: outage_mode AND NOT
// reconciled). The disjointness is enforced here by the ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE
// WHERE guard (see consumer.go) and is formally exercised by BF0.4b's
// integration test.
