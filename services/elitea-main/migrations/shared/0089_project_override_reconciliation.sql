-- 0089_project_override_reconciliation.sql — deliver the corpus's default-mode
-- grants to the projects that carry their own permission rows.
--
-- THE DEFECT. legacyrbac's projectPermissions() reads the central default-mode
-- grants under `WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM project_permissions)`
-- (internal/infra/legacyrbac/postgres.go). Suppression is ALL OR NOTHING per
-- caller: if any project role the caller holds carries one
-- auth_core__project_role_permission row, the whole central set is discarded
-- for that caller in that project.
--
-- Every permission migration in this corpus writes CENTRAL rows only. So every
-- one of them is inert in a project that carries overrides, and the product's
-- own admin console is what creates those overrides:
--
--   "Apply to Projects"                     internal/api/v2/admin/roles.go
--   PUT /admin/permissions/{public|support}/{mode}
--   PUT /admin/user_project_permissions/administration
--                                           internal/api/v2/admin/user_project_permissions.go
--
-- An operator presses one of them once. Every touched project stops reading the
-- central matrix. The next release ships a migration for a newly gated route,
-- the migration writes central rows, and every member of those projects gets
-- 403 "insufficient permissions" on the new route with nothing to point at.
-- The end-to-end stack already lives with this: apps/elitea-web/scripts/
-- e2e-stack.sh has to hand-list `models.applications.index_meta.details`
-- "because project 1 carries per-project rows".
--
-- THE RULE IS NOT THE BUG. The suppression rule is pylon's documented contract
-- and TestAProjectWithItsOwnGrantsIsRefusedEveryGate pins it. What pylon pairs
-- it with, and this corpus never adopted, is a backfill: when the platform adds
-- a permission, the projects that hold their own matrix are given it too. This
-- file is that backfill, applied once to the whole estate.
--
-- WHAT IT WRITES, AND THE ONE THING IT WILL NOT DO.
--
-- It is keyed on (project_id, role_id), because that is how the resolver reads:
-- suppression is per caller-role-set, so a project role that carries NO
-- override rows still falls back and must not be handed a snapshot it never
-- had.
--
-- It does NOT copy every central grant. A pair (role name, permission) that
-- some project already carries as an override is left alone, everywhere. The
-- reason is operator intent: those admin screens SET a matrix, so an operator
-- can narrow a project by saving it without a permission. A blanket copy of the
-- central set would silently reverse every such decision across the estate on
-- upgrade. A pair that appears in NO project's override rows cannot have been
-- revoked by anyone — it is platform surface that never reached the estate at
-- all — and that is exactly the class this file exists to deliver.
--
-- The cost of that restraint is stated plainly: a permission that ONE project
-- revoked stays undelivered to EVERY project with overrides. Repairing those
-- needs an operator decision per project, and the admin console is where that
-- belongs.
--
-- KEEPING IT TRUE. This file reconciles the corpus as of 0089. A later
-- migration that adds a central default-mode grant must carry its own override
-- block, or the projects with overrides never see it.
-- migrations/project_override_reconciliation_test.go is the gate: it fails when
-- a shared migration after 0089 writes auth_core__role_permission in `default`
-- mode and does not also write auth_core__project_role_permission.
