-- 0095_identity_providers.sql — the TYPED identity provider revision: the
-- authored definition of how this deployment federates a login.
--
-- WHAT THIS REPLACES. The admin Configuration page's "Authentication" section
-- describes a pylon plugin's YAML. `auth_provider: form | oidc` selects which
-- of the `pylon_auth` plugins registers the login routes, and the OIDC values
-- (`metadata_endpoint`, `client_id`, `client_secret`) are keys inside
-- `auth_oidc/config.yml`. `auth_saml/config.yml` holds the parallel set
-- (`sp_key`, `sp_cert`, `idp_cert`, `authn_destination`, `saml_issuer`). The
-- reference page edits them by shipping patched plugin YAML over the Arbiter
-- bus, and a pylon reloads its descriptor.
--
-- This service loads no plugins. Until now the only federation configuration it
-- had was four environment variables read once at boot
-- (`internal/api/v2/auth/oidc.go:OIDCConfigFromEnv`), so an operator could not
-- change an identity provider without a redeploy, and the admin section that
-- exists to change one refused with a sentence about the Arbiter bus.
--
-- WHY ONE ROW PER PROVIDER AND NOT A SETTINGS DOCUMENT. The configuration
-- provenance specification requires "one typed OIDC provider revision owns all
-- values" and "one typed SAML provider revision", because pylon spreads
-- response type, scopes, endpoints, client authentication and verification
-- behaviour through code at three separate call sites, and a flat settings
-- document reproduces exactly that scattering. A row is the revision: `config`
-- carries the whole typed document for one provider, `revision` counts its
-- authored versions, and no value that the login path reads lives anywhere
-- else.
--
-- WHY NOT `centry.platform_config`. Two reasons, and either alone is decisive.
-- An OIDC client secret and a SAML service-provider private key are
-- credentials, and `internal/api/v2/admin/config_values.go:rejectCredentialField`
-- refuses a credential into those rows — correctly, because every holder of
-- `runtime.plugins` can read them. And the plugin-config write path stores a
-- section as untyped field values, which cannot express "this document is an
-- OIDC provider and these are the invariants it must satisfy".
--
-- SECRETS ARE NOT HERE. `secret_ref` names an entry in the GLOBAL vault's
-- hidden bucket (`centry.secrets_key`/`secrets_data`, vault id `admin`, see
-- `internal/api/v2/secrets/admin_hidden.go`). The hidden bucket is excluded
-- from the merge that project workloads interpolate `{{secret.<name>}}`
-- against, so a client secret stored there cannot be read back by an agent.
-- This table holds the reference, never the value. `config` is non-secret by
-- construction: issuer URLs, client identifiers, scopes, certificates of the
-- identity provider (a certificate is public material), and the algorithm and
-- clock-skew policy.
--
-- AT MOST ONE ENABLED PROVIDER PER KIND. The router mounts one route set per
-- protocol — `/forward-auth/auth_oidc/*` and `/forward-auth/auth_saml/*`. Two
-- enabled OIDC rows would mean two definitions competing for one callback URL,
-- and the login path would have to pick one with no rule for which. The partial
-- unique index makes that unrepresentable rather than resolved arbitrarily at
-- request time. An operator who prepares a replacement provider leaves it
-- disabled and flips the pair in one transaction.
--
-- A DISABLED ROW KEEPS ITS SECRET REFERENCE. That is why `enabled` exists at
-- all instead of the operator deleting the row: withdrawing a provider must not
-- destroy the sealed credential that restoring it would need.
--
-- REVISION IS MONOTONIC PER ROW, and it is what lets a reader cache a
-- constructed provider. OIDC discovery is a network round trip, and the login
-- path must not make one per request. The resolver caches by
-- (provider_key, revision), so an authored change invalidates the cache exactly
-- when the document changed and never otherwise.
--
-- NO FOREIGN KEYS. The table references nothing. A provider is a deployment
-- fact, not a tenant's.
--
-- WHY SHARED, NOT TENANT. Federation is platform-wide: the browser reaches
-- `/forward-auth/auth_oidc/login` before any project is selected, so there is
-- no tenant in scope when the definition is read.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT throughout. No BEGIN/COMMIT: the ledgered runner executes each
-- file inside one transaction with its ledger row (migrate/runner.go apply).
