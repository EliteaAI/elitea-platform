-- 0073_mcp_tool_registry.sql — the durable store of MCP servers registered into
-- a project, and of the tools each server publishes (issue 335).
--
-- WHAT THIS ADDS. `GET /api/v2/elitea_core/tools_list/{projectID}` reports the
-- MCP servers that a project can drive, and the tools on each one. The Python
-- execution worker reads that list to build an agent's MCP tools. Until now the
-- only store was a dictionary inside a running pylon process
-- (`elitea_core/utils/mcp_servers_storage.py`), so the hybrid edge sent the call
-- to pylon and an MCP agent could not run without it. These two tables are the
-- store, so the Go service can answer from rows.
--
-- WHY A NEW SCHEMA. pylon owns no MCP table. A search of every `__tablename__`
-- in the plugin tree returns no MCP relation, and no pylon migration creates
-- one. So this corpus claims nothing that pylon already owns, and the seeds
-- cannot fail with 42P07.
--
-- WHY SHARED AND NOT TENANT. The read unions two projects: the caller's
-- personal project and the current one (pylon
-- `methods/mcp_sse.py:get_registered_servers_private_and_current`). A per-tenant
-- table would make that one read into two reads against two schemas that are
-- migrated independently. One shared table with a `project_id` column answers it
-- in a single statement.
--
-- project_id CARRIES NO FOREIGN KEY. `centry.project` is a pylon-owned table,
-- and 0071 records the same decision for the same reason. Project membership is
-- checked by the route's authorization middleware before any row is read.
--
-- NO to_regclass GUARD IS NEEDED HERE. The guards in 0060, 0061, 0062 and 0071
-- protect a REFERENCES clause that points at a pylon table which
-- `001_initial.sql` may not have created yet. This file references only its own
-- relations, so it is safe on an empty database.
--
-- SECRETS STAY OUT. The table holds a server name, a URL, timeouts and tool
-- descriptors. It does not hold the HTTP headers that authenticate a call to
-- that server. Bearer credentials do not enter this corpus (AGENTS.md).
--
-- IDEMPOTENT throughout: IF NOT EXISTS on the schema, both tables and every
-- index.
--
-- No BEGIN/COMMIT: the ledgered runner executes each file inside one
-- transaction with its ledger row (migrate/runner.go apply).
