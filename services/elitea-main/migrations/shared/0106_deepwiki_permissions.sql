-- 0106_deepwiki_permissions.sql — the two DEFAULT-mode grants behind the
-- DeepWiki facade (ADR-0022, phase P2).
--
--   models.applications.deepwiki.read      ← GET  /deepwiki/slots/{project_id}
--                                            GET  /deepwiki/invocations/...
--   models.applications.deepwiki.generate  ← POST /deepwiki/tools/.../invoke
--                                            DELETE /deepwiki/invocations/...
--
-- WHY THESE NAMES ARE NOT A TRANSCRIPTION. Every other grant file in this
-- corpus restores a string that legacy already declared, and says where it
-- came from. This one cannot: the legacy `deepwiki_plugin` has no `api/`
-- package and no `check_api` call anywhere in it. Its five routes
-- (descriptor, health, slots, invoke, invocations) were reached by the pylon
-- provider hub over mTLS and authorised by the HOP, never by a project role.
-- testdata/legacy/legacy-rbac-static-catalog.json therefore carries nothing
-- for it, and neither does testdata/postgres/legacy-rbac-matrix.json.
--
-- So these are new strings, chosen rather than recovered — 0104 was the first
-- file here to do that, for Agent Evaluation, and this is the second. The
-- naming follows the corpus convention for authored project content
-- (`models.applications.*`) because that is what a generated wiki is: one
-- project's content, produced from that project's repositories.
--
-- WHY THE SPLIT IS READ/GENERATE AND NOT READ/WRITE. Reading capacity is what
-- the UI polls to decide whether to offer the button at all, and polling an
-- invocation is how it follows one already running. Gating those behind the
-- write grant would make the page 403 for everyone allowed to look but not to
-- generate — a viewer would see a broken screen rather than a disabled button.
-- Starting a generation is the expensive, side-effectful half: it clones a
-- repository, spends model budget and writes an index. Cancelling is grouped
-- with it, not with the reads, because stopping another member's running
-- generation is a mutation of shared state and not an observation of it.
--
-- Viewer therefore holds the read and not the generate. That is the same
-- asymmetry 0105 records from legacy's own predict_llm declarations, arrived
-- at here from the route semantics rather than from a dump.
--
-- WHY A NEW FILE. Migrations here are checksum-immutable; nothing already
-- applied can be appended to. And the route is gated on these strings by
-- internal/api/v2/deepwiki/route.go, so without this file the facade would
-- ship registered and refuse every caller — 0063's stated consequence, "403
-- for everyone, which reads as a broken page rather than as a missing grant".
--
-- BLAST RADIUS. Additive and idempotent: it grants to roles that already
-- exist, never creates one, and conflicts are ignored. The facade itself is
-- mounted only when ELITEA_DEEPWIKI_ENABLED is set, so on every deployment
-- that has not turned it on these two strings grant access to nothing.
--
-- The central grant alone would be inert on any project carrying its own
-- permission rows, because legacyrbac's projectPermissions() discards the
-- central set wholesale for those callers — shared/0090's header and
-- migrations/project_override_reconciliation_test.go both say so. The second
-- statement is that override delivery. It is unconditional, as 0105's is: these
-- strings have never existed on any deployment, so no operator can have
-- narrowed a saved matrix to exclude them. Every omission is an absence.
--
-- 0060's VIRGIN-mode guard is not reproduced, for the reason 0061/0062/0063/
-- 0066/0068/0102/0104/0105 all give: never granted anywhere, so never revoked.
-- `system` and `super_admin` are omitted, as everywhere else in this corpus.
