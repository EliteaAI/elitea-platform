-- 0064_centry_social_pins.sql — the table every configuration read joins.
--
-- `queries/configurations.sql:57` reads `centry.social_pins` to project each
-- row's `is_pinned`, so EVERY call to
-- `GET /api/v2/configurations/configurations/{projectID}` failed with
--
--   ERROR: relation "centry.social_pins" does not exist (SQLSTATE 42P01)
--
-- on any deployment where nothing had created it (#293). The chat model picker
-- reads that route, so a user could not choose a model, so an agent turn was
-- rejected for not naming one — three layers from the actual cause.
--
-- Why nothing created it. `internal/db/schema/centry_projects_baseline.sql`
-- DECLARES the table, which is what let the query compile — but that file is a
-- sqlc compiler input and says so in its own header: "This file is NOT a
-- runtime migration." In a pylon deployment the Projects plugin owns the table.
-- `001_initial.sql:585` does create a `social_pins`, but inside each TENANT
-- schema (`%I.social_pins`), which is a different table from the `centry` one
-- this query names. So the schema the generator type-checks against and the
-- schema the server runs against disagreed, and nothing in the build could see
-- it: sqlc was satisfied, and the failure only appears at runtime, on a route
-- no test had ever reached.
--
-- IF NOT EXISTS is load-bearing rather than defensive: on a pylon-backed
-- database the table already exists and is owned there, and this migration must
-- leave it exactly as it is. Column order, types and the uniqueness constraint
-- are transcribed from the baseline projection so the two cannot drift.
