-- 0107_provider_admitted_revisions.sql — the provider ADMISSION plane
-- (ADR-0012 phase P3, and the storage the three service-descriptor routes have
-- been refusing for want of).
--
-- WHAT THIS REPLACES. internal/api/v2/eliteacore/service_descriptors.go answers
-- 501 on all three routes, and its header sets out at length why: there is no
-- table to read, and two of the four columns the page shows never came from
-- storage at all. `healthy` was which of two in-process Python dicts an entry
-- landed in when a pylon worker last started, and the row set was the union of
-- those dicts rather than a query.
--
-- This corpus does not reproduce that shape. ADR-0012 replaces the mutable
-- descriptor blob with an admitted, immutable revision reached through review,
-- and replaces the free-form service_location_url with a normalised reviewed
-- origin. Four tables, and the split between them is the design:
--
--   provider_origin_registration — WHO may be reached. One normalised origin
--     per (project, provider), reviewed once. Mutable: an operator may correct
--     an origin without republishing a manifest.
--   provider_published_manifest  — WHAT was published. Content-addressed and
--     INSERT-ONLY: the digest IS the key, so the same bytes published twice
--     are one row and a manifest can never be edited under an admission that
--     already cites it.
--   provider_admitted_revision   — WHAT THIS DEPLOYMENT ADMITS. The join of an
--     origin and a manifest, with a lifecycle.
--   provider_health_projection   — WHETHER IT ANSWERED, LAST TIME ANYONE
--     ASKED. A separate table because health is a PROJECTION, not a property.
--
-- THE HEALTH SPLIT IS THE POINT, and it is the whole lesson of the file this
-- migration unblocks. Storing `healthy` on the revision row would reproduce
-- pylon's category error in durable form: a boolean that looks like a fact
-- about the provider when it is a fact about the last probe. A projection has
-- an observed_at, so a reader can tell "unhealthy" from "nobody has asked
-- lately" — and the API answers `healthy: null` for the second, which is the
-- one answer the pylon page could never give.
--
-- TWO CONSTRAINTS CARRY THE ARCHITECTURE, both at the bottom of this file:
--
--   UNIQUE (project_id, provider_id) WHERE status = 'active'
--   CHECK  (status <> 'active' OR overlay_revision IS NOT NULL)
--
-- The second is ADR-0012's "a missing overlay policy fails admission" written
-- as a constraint instead of a TODO. This deployment can RECORD and SHOW a
-- descriptor and physically CANNOT activate one, because it has no way to
-- issue an overlay yet. That is deliberate: a registration surface for a
-- runtime that cannot invoke what it registers is worse than a refusal, and
-- the constraint is what stops the next change from quietly crossing that line.
--
-- NOTHING HERE IS OWNED BY PYLON. These are new tables in a new schema; no
-- legacy table is claimed, adopted or renamed. The corpus has been broken
-- three times by a migration claiming a pylon-owned table and colliding with a
-- seeded fixture at 42P07, and this file cannot do that.
