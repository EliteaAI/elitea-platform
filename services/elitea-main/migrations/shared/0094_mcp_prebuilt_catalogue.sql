-- 0094_mcp_prebuilt_catalogue.sql — the PRE-BUILT MCP server catalogue: the
-- platform-wide list of MCP servers an operator offers as ready-made toolkits.
--
-- WHAT THIS REPLACES. In pylon the catalogue is a block of the indexer_worker
-- plugin's YAML descriptor:
--
--     mcp_servers:
--       Epam Presales:
--         client_id: "…"
--         client_secret: "…"
--         timeout: 30
--         base_url: "https://api.example.com"
--       GitHub Copilot:
--         url: "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
--
-- `indexer_worker/methods/indexer_mcp_prebuilt_config.py` reads that block,
-- normalises each key and emits `application_mcp_prebuilt_config_collected` on
-- the Arbiter event bus; `elitea_core` caches the payload in module state
-- (`self.mcp_prebuilt_configs`) and serves it to five call sites through
-- `get_mcp_prebuilt_config()` and `resolve_mcp_prebuilt_settings()`.
--
-- None of that machinery exists here: this service loads no plugins, has no
-- descriptor to patch and speaks no Arbiter. So the admin Configuration page's
-- "MCP Servers" section had nothing behind it, and
-- `internal/api/v2/eliteacore/handler.go` refused a URL-less sync with the
-- sentence "this service does not hold the pre-built MCP catalogue". This table
-- is that catalogue.
--
-- WHY A TABLE AND NOT A `centry.platform_config` ROW. The catalogue holds
-- credentials — pylon's own example block carries `client_secret` in clear
-- text. `internal/api/v2/admin/config_values.go:rejectCredentialField` refuses
-- any credential into a plaintext platform-configuration row, and that rule is
-- right: those rows are readable by every holder of `runtime.plugins`. So the
-- secret does NOT live here either. `client_secret_ref` names an entry in the
-- GLOBAL secret vault (`centry.secrets_key`/`secrets_data`, vault id `admin`),
-- and the value is sealed there by the admin write path. This table holds the
-- reference, never the secret.
--
-- HTTP ONLY, AND THAT IS NOT AN OMISSION. The reference page's field help says
-- the section "supports stdio (local subprocess) and http (remote) server
-- types". A stdio server is a child process on the host that runs the MCP
-- client; this service starts no subprocesses and has no host to start one on,
-- and `internal/mcpregistry.Discoverer` speaks streamable HTTP and nothing
-- else. Storing a stdio row would be storing a definition that no code path in
-- this stack can honour, so the catalogue is HTTP-only and the admin write
-- refuses a stdio definition with that reason rather than accepting it into a
-- column nobody reads.
--
-- WHY SHARED. The catalogue is platform-wide by construction: pylon's copy is
-- one dictionary per deployment, offered to every project. A per-tenant table
-- would make one platform fact into N copies that drift.
--
-- catalogue_key IS THE NORMALISED NAME, and it is what a toolkit type is
-- matched against. pylon normalises on both sides — the producer lowercases the
-- YAML key and turns spaces into underscores, and `normalize_mcp_toolkit_name`
-- additionally strips a leading `mcp_` from the toolkit type before the lookup.
-- Storing the normalised form is what makes the lookup a single indexed read
-- instead of a scan with a transform.
--
-- NO FOREIGN KEYS. The table references nothing. 0073 records the same for
-- `project_id`, and this table has no project at all.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT throughout. No BEGIN/COMMIT: the ledgered runner executes each
-- file inside one transaction with its ledger row (migrate/runner.go apply).
