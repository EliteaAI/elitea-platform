-- CHOSEN, NOT RECOVERED — the third file here to do that, after 0104 and 0106,
-- and for the same reason 0106 gives: the legacy `inventory_plugin` has no
-- `api/` package and no `check_api` call. Its routes were reached by the pylon
-- provider hub over mTLS and authorised by the HOP, never by a project role,
-- so there is nothing in the legacy catalogue to transcribe.
--
-- The split mirrors 0106's read/generate for the same reason: reading capacity
-- is what a screen polls to decide whether to offer a control, and gating that
-- behind the write grant would 403 everyone allowed to look but not to act.
-- The grant blocks below are 0106's, with the two strings substituted. The
-- structure is copied deliberately rather than factored out: each one names
-- its own permissions inline, and a shared procedure would put the strings a
-- migration grants somewhere a reader of that migration cannot see.
