-- 0068_elitea_core_route_permissions.sql — the DEFAULT-mode grants the
-- /elitea_core per-route permission gates (#302, #313) are resolved against.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and why it had to land WITH the gating rather than
-- after it. #302's first pass closed the cross-tenant hole at the MEMBERSHIP
-- tier and deliberately stopped there, because the permission NAMES were
-- recoverable but nothing granted them: measured against a real database
-- (internal/infra/db/migrations/001_initial.sql plus the whole shared history
-- on pgvector:0.8.1-pg18), a Go-bootstrapped deployment resolves exactly SEVEN
-- default-mode permissions — `models.project_context.view` (0062),
-- `models.monitoring.tracing.view`, `models.chat.messages.list`,
-- `models.chat.messages.details` (0063) and the three
-- `models.applications.index_meta.*` strings (0066). The routes gated in this
-- change need roughly sixty more. 0063's header states the consequence:
-- "gating a route on a permission nothing grants is 403-for-everyone, which
-- reads as a broken page rather than as a missing grant" — the same shape as
-- #93's `index_meta.details`, which presented as an indefinitely-loading rail
-- rather than as a refusal.
--
-- WHERE THE SPLIT COMES FROM. Every string below is transcribed from
-- testdata/postgres/legacy-rbac-matrix.json, exported from a real legacy
-- database by scripts/database/export_legacy_rbac_matrix.sql, at the
-- `mode = 'default'` rows for the `admin`, `editor` and `viewer` roles. It is
-- parity restoration, not a new policy: this is what a pylon-backed deployment
-- already resolves today. Nothing here is inferred from the route's verb — the
-- matrix disagrees with the obvious guess in several places and the matrix
-- wins:
--
--   * `models.applications.upload_icon.get` is admin/editor only. A viewer
--     cannot LIST uploaded icons even though it is a read.
--   * `models.applications.task.delete` and `models.applications.fork.post`
--     are granted to viewer even though both are writes.
--   * `models.chat.conversations.delete` is granted to viewer; the neighbouring
--     `models.chat.conversation.edit` is not.
--   * `configuration.roles.permissions.view` is default-mode ADMIN only, which
--     is why no product route in this change is gated on it (see the router's
--     note on `/permissions/prompt_lib/{projectID}`, which stays ungated
--     because it is the caller's own permission self-read — pylon's
--     counterpart, auth/api/v2/permissions.py, carries no guard either).
--
-- The permission NAMES come from testdata/legacy/legacy-rbac-static-catalog.json
-- (machine-generated from the pylon `check_api` declarations), matched per
-- module and per verb. internal/api/router_elitea_core_permission_map_test.go
-- re-checks both directions against those two files, so a name that exists in
-- neither, or a gate whose permission this file does not grant, fails the build
-- rather than shipping as a 403.
--
-- BLAST RADIUS. `legacyrbac`'s projectPermissions() falls back to the CENTRAL
-- default-mode grants by role NAME only for a project that carries NO
-- per-project role_permission rows. That is the fresh-Go-database shape. It is
-- never the shape of a pylon-backed database, of a legacy dump, or of the E2E
-- stack, all of which seed per-project rows and therefore suppress the fallback
-- entirely — so no existing deployment's members gain anything here (pinned in
-- internal/infra/legacyrbac/elitea_core_route_grant_postgres_integration_test.go,
-- the same way 0062's, 0063's and 0066's blast radius is pinned). The fallback
-- is also joined THROUGH the caller's assigned project roles, so a non-member
-- has no row to fall back from and gains nothing at all.
--
-- Members' permission sets are already non-empty since 0062, so this changes no
-- set-emptiness transition of the kind #276 tracks.
--
-- Idempotent and additive: it grants to roles that already exist, never creates
-- one, and conflicts are ignored. `system` and `super_admin` are omitted, as
-- everywhere else in this corpus. 0060's VIRGIN-mode guard is NOT reproduced,
-- for the reason 0061/0062/0063/0066 all give — these permissions have never
-- existed on a Go deployment, so no operator can have revoked them, and
-- skipping configured deployments would leave exactly those unable to reach the
-- routes.
