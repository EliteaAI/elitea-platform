-- 0096_scim_provisioning.sql — the side table SCIM 2.0 user provisioning needs.
--
-- WHAT SCIM IS FOR HERE. An identity provider (Okta, Entra ID, OneLogin) that
-- federates logins can also PUSH the directory: create an account when a person
-- joins, update it when their name or address changes, and deactivate it when
-- they leave. Without it, an account is created on first login and never
-- removed — a person who leaves the company keeps a working account until
-- somebody remembers to suspend it by hand.
--
-- Nothing in this platform did SCIM before this migration, and neither did
-- pylon: `grep -ril scim legacy/plugins/` finds nothing. This is not a port.
--
-- WHY A SIDE TABLE AND NOT COLUMNS ON `auth_core__user`. That table is owned by
-- the pylon schema (internal/infra/db/migrations/001_initial.sql seeds it, and a
-- pylon-managed deployment creates it). Claiming a pylon-owned table in a shared
-- migration has broken this repository's seeds three times with a 42P07, and the
-- rule that came out of it is: read and UPDATE those rows, never change their
-- shape. So the SCIM-specific facts live here, keyed by the user id.
--
-- The person's identity itself stays where it already is:
--
--   * `auth_core__user.email`     is the SCIM `userName` and primary email.
--   * `auth_core__user.name`      is the SCIM `displayName`.
--   * `auth_core__user.suspended` is the inverse of the SCIM `active` flag.
--
-- Only `externalId` and the resource timestamps have nowhere to go, and they are
-- what this table holds.
--
-- EXTERNAL_ID IS THE IDENTITY PROVIDER'S OWN KEY, and it is UNIQUE. SCIM clients
-- use it to find the resource they created when they have lost the local id, and
-- two accounts claiming one external id would make that lookup ambiguous — the
-- client would update whichever the database returned first.
--
-- WHY SHARED, NOT TENANT. A directory is platform-wide: the identity provider
-- pushes people, not project members, and the accounts it creates exist before
-- any project selects them.
--
-- NO FOREIGN KEY, and this is the same rule 0094 and 0095 state. It is not a
-- preference: the shared corpus MUST be applicable on its own. `migrate.
-- ApplyShared` runs this set against a database that may hold nothing else —
-- every `dbtest` template and several integration harnesses do exactly that —
-- and `auth_core__user` is created by a DIFFERENT corpus
-- (internal/infra/db/migrations/001_initial.sql) or by pylon's own migrations.
-- A `REFERENCES auth_core__user(id)` here made 0096 fail with a 42P01 on every
-- such database, which took six unrelated artifact suites down with it.
--
-- WHAT THE FOREIGN KEY WOULD HAVE BOUGHT was `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Without it, an
-- operator who hard-deletes an account from the admin Users page leaves a row
-- here whose `user_id` names nothing. Such a row is INERT for every read: each
-- one joins from `auth_core__user` outwards, so a row with no account is never
-- returned. The one thing it could still do is hold an `external_id` the
-- identity provider later re-uses, so `upsertSCIMFacts` clears a stale claim
-- whose account is gone before it inserts. See internal/scimdirectory.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT throughout. No BEGIN/COMMIT: the ledgered runner executes each
-- file inside one transaction with its ledger row (migrate/runner.go apply).
