-- Shared conversation links: the store behind "share a conversation by link".
--
-- WHY THIS IS A *SHARED* MIGRATION AND NOT A TENANT ONE
--
-- Every other chat object in this repository is tenant-scoped: chat_conversations,
-- chat_message_group and friends live in `p_<project_id>` (migrations/tenant/0123,
-- 0126, 0127). A share link is about a conversation, so tenant looks like the
-- obvious home. It is the wrong one, and the reason is the LOOKUP KEY.
--
-- The unauthenticated view endpoint is handed a token and NOTHING else — no
-- project, no session, no membership. Resolving a token against a tenant table
-- would mean either enumerating every `p_%` schema in the database on each
-- anonymous request (an unauthenticated caller could then drive a
-- schema-count-proportional scan by guessing tokens: a trivially available
-- amplification), or smuggling the project id into the token so the server can
-- pick the schema from caller-supplied input. The second is worse than the first:
-- it makes the token structured and therefore partially guessable, and it hands
-- an anonymous caller a way to steer which schema is queried.
--
-- One central table keyed on the token settles both. The project id is a COLUMN,
-- read out of the row the token resolved to, so the tenant schema the reader
-- then queries is server-derived and never caller-derived.
--
-- The schema is a NEW one this repository owns end to end (`elitea_chat`), in
-- the same style as elitea_auth (0095), elitea_mcp (0094), elitea_identity and
-- elitea_runtime. It is deliberately not `centry.`: that schema is pylon's, and
-- claiming an object in it is how a migration collides with a shape someone else
-- owns.
--
-- WHAT IS STORED, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT
--
-- `token_hash`, NOT the token. The token is a bearer credential for conversation
-- content: anyone holding it reads the transcript with no further authentication.
-- Storing it in plaintext means a database dump, a log of a SELECT, or a
-- read-only replica compromise is immediately a set of working links against
-- every shared conversation in the deployment. So the column holds SHA-256 of
-- the token and the token itself exists exactly once, in the response to the
-- POST that created it.
--
-- SHA-256, unsalted and uniterated, is the right primitive HERE and would be
-- wrong for a password. The input is 256 bits from crypto/rand, so there is no
-- dictionary to run and no offline advantage to be had from iteration; what the
-- hash has to be is FAST, because it is computed on every anonymous view. The
-- password columns below are the opposite case and are treated as such.
--
-- `password_hash` + `password_salt` are PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 over a per-link
-- 128-bit random salt. That input IS user-chosen and low-entropy, so the
-- iteration count is the defence, and the salt is what stops one derived table
-- covering every link in the deployment. Both columns are NULL together for a
-- link with no password; the CHECK below makes "half a password" a state the
-- table cannot hold, so no reader has to decide what a salt with no hash means.
--
-- No copy of the conversation, its messages, or its participants is stored. The
-- link is a POINTER plus a scope; the view reads the live conversation through
-- the project id in this row. That is what makes deleting a message actually
-- un-share it, rather than leaving a frozen copy readable by a link nobody
-- remembers issuing.
--
-- REVOCATION AND EXPIRY ARE BOTH ROWS, NOT ABSENCES
--
-- `revoked_at` is a timestamp rather than a DELETE so that a revoked link
-- remains distinguishable from one that never existed FOR THE OWNER (the
-- listing can show it), while the anonymous view answers both with the same
-- 404 — see the handler's doc comment for why that symmetry is load-bearing.
--
-- `expires_at` is NOT NULL. A never-expiring link is a credential with no end
-- of life, handed to an audience the issuer stops thinking about within a day;
-- the API caps it instead, and the column's NOT NULL is what makes "no expiry"
-- unrepresentable rather than merely un-offered by the current UI.
--
-- Idempotent statements throughout, as the rest of this corpus is: dev and
-- dump-loaded databases reach this file in several different states. No
-- BEGIN/COMMIT — the ledgered runner wraps each file in one transaction with
-- its ledger row (migrate/runner.go apply).
