-- Administration-mode RBAC backfill for databases that already exist.
--
-- Why this is needed at all
-- ------------------------
-- internal/api/router.go now gates the admin panel's READS on the same pylon
-- permissions their Python counterparts declare — `GET /admin/auth_users/{mode}`
-- on `admin.auth.users`, and the rest of the block on `runtime.plugins`,
-- `projects.projects.projects.view`, `configuration.roles.permissions.view` and
-- `admin.moderation`. Unit A14 gated only the writes precisely because that
-- change was unsafe without this one: `legacyrbac.PostgresResolver` resolves
-- those permissions out of auth_core__role/…__role_permission/…__user_role, and
-- a database bootstrapped by the pre-A14 internal/infra/db/migrations/
-- 001_initial.sql had NO administration-mode role and NO role_permission row of
-- any kind. Every central permission resolved to the empty set, so a gated read
-- would answer 403 to every user including the operator.
--
-- Who this actually affects
-- -------------------------
--   * pylon-backed deployments (dev.elitea.ai, deploy/centry-hybrid's
--     pov-compose, any legacy dump) already have the roles and the grants:
--     auth_core/db/migrations/202202021633_core.py seeds the roles, and pylon's
--     `check_api` decorator inserts the role_permission rows from
--     `recommended_roles` at import time. Nothing here should apply to them,
--     and the guard below makes sure of it.
--   * fresh Go databases get everything from 001_initial.sql, which now seeds
--     the same rows. This migration finds them already present and no-ops.
--   * databases created by the OLD 001_initial.sql — existing developer and CI
--     databases, and any long-lived E2E volume — are the real target. They are
--     the only ones with an empty administration mode.
--
-- The guard
-- ---------
-- Everything runs only when the administration mode is VIRGIN: no
-- administration-mode role exists at all. That is deliberately stricter than
-- "the specific rows I want are missing". A deployment that has an
-- administration mode has an operator who may have REVOKED a grant through the
-- admin Permissions page, and a migration that re-inserted it would silently
-- undo that decision. Absent means never-configured; it does not mean
-- configured-to-empty.
