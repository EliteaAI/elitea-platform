-- Give the agent-execution chat tables an owner in this repository.
--
-- internal/db/queries/{agent_chat,agent_cancel}.sql reference this table set
-- 155 times, and until now no migration created any of it.
-- internal/db/schema/agent_chat_baseline.sql declares it for the sqlc
-- compiler and says why it is not a migration: "These tables already exist in
-- each p_<project_id> schema and remain owned by the current tenant-schema
-- lifecycle." That lifecycle is pylon's. The assumption holds in
-- deploy/centry-hybrid, which still runs pylon_main; it does not hold in a
-- deployment built to drop pylon, where an authenticated agent turn fails with
-- `relation "chat_messages_text" does not exist` (SQLSTATE 42P01) before it
-- can dispatch. See #287.
--
-- This migration owns the WHOLE graph, not just the three leaf tables the
-- 42P01 named. An earlier revision created only chat_messages_text,
-- chat_messages_context and chat_message_trace_step, and took the five tables
-- they hang off — chat_conversations, chat_participants,
-- chat_participant_mapping, chat_message_group, chat_message_items — as
-- pre-existing. Nothing in this repository creates those either, so the
-- omission failed twice over: the leaves' REFERENCES clauses had no target, so
-- the tenant chain could not apply to a clean database at all, and a pylon-free
-- deployment that got past that would still have met the same 42P01 one table
-- further in. It was invisible during the first round because the only stack it
-- was verified against restores a staging dump (deploy/scripts/load-staging-dump.sh),
-- where pylon had already created all eight.
--
-- Every statement is IF NOT EXISTS because in a mixed deployment pylon has
-- already created these tables and owns their shape: there this migration must
-- record itself and change nothing. It becomes the definition only where
-- nothing else defines them. That is also why the parents are added to this
-- migration rather than a later one — 0123 must not reference a table that a
-- higher version number has yet to create, and it has never been applied
-- anywhere durable, only to local clean-slate stacks.
--
-- The column lists mirror agent_chat_baseline.sql exactly, with two corrections
-- the projection could not express:
--
-- * chat_message_trace_step.id is declared there as a bare `bigint PRIMARY
--   KEY`, but repos/agent_trace.go inserts a trace step WITHOUT supplying an
--   id, so the column must carry a default. The integration fixtures that
--   exercise that insert use BIGSERIAL
--   (index_activity_postgres_integration_test.go:553,
--   messagetraces_postgres_integration_test.go:174); a projection has no reason
--   to record a default, so sqlc's view dropped it.
--
-- * chat_conversations.uuid gets DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(). The projection
--   records none, but deploy/scripts/fix-uuid-defaults.sql exists purely to add
--   that default back to this column across every deployed project schema, so a
--   schema we create ourselves should not be born needing the repair.

-- The conversation a message group belongs to, and the participants that author
-- and receive it. No query in this repository INSERTs into either — conversation
-- and participant creation still happens outside the Go service — but every
-- agent-turn read joins through them, so they have to exist for the graph below
-- to have anywhere to point.
