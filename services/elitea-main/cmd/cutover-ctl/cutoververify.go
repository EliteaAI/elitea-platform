// cutover-verify (spec BFC.9, post-cutover gate):
//
// After the big-bang cutover this gate confirms that the migration is truly
// complete and no legacy path remains active. It checks four invariants:
//
//  1. Zero gateway 5xx responses over the observation window: the gateway must
//     be stable. Any 5xx indicates a broken route that needs attention.
//  2. The runtime_engine_litellm subprocess is ABSENT from pylon-indexer pods:
//     pylon-indexer must no longer spawn LiteLLM as a child process. Its
//     presence means the pod image was not rolled or the env flag was not set.
//  3. Zero traffic to litellm-svc:4000: the internal LiteLLM service must be
//     receiving no traffic. Any positive RPS means callers are still hitting the
//     legacy path.
//  4. The 402-hard-block is confirmed: the gateway must respond 402 Payment
//     Required when the project budget is exhausted. Without this, quota
//     enforcement is broken post-cutover.
//
// # Real (live) mode
//
// The real gate gathers state from live cluster sources:
//   - Prometheus: query rate(elitea_gateway_http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[Wm]) == 0
//   - kubectl exec / pod metrics: ps aux | grep runtime_engine_litellm
//   - Prometheus: query rate(elitea_litellm_svc_requests_total[Wm]) == 0
//   - HTTP probe: POST /llm/v1/chat/completions with an exhausted budget → expect 402
//
// Flags for live mode: --deploy, --port, --litellm-svc, --window-m
//
// # Hermetic (fixture) mode
//
// For CI and offline verification, pass --fixture <path> to a JSON file
// encoding a cutoverState struct. The gate evaluates the check logic against
// the fixture data and exits 0/non-zero accordingly. This exercises the exact
// same evaluateCutover function that the live mode uses — the only difference
// is how the state is populated.
//
// See testdata/cutover_state_clean.json  (should pass)
// See testdata/cutover_state_dirty.json  (should fail)

// cutoverState is the injectable state struct used by both the live and fixture
// paths. In a real run each field is populated by querying k8s/Prometheus/HTTP;
// in a hermetic run it is loaded from a JSON fixture file.
