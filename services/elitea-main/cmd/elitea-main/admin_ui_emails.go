// the injected `user_name`, found it empty, and fell back to the generic word
// "Admin" on every load. This read fills it.

// after the permission resolver has already confirmed the user exists and is

// value is a nil *pgxpool.Pool inside a struct field, not inside an interface,
// so this test is a real one.
