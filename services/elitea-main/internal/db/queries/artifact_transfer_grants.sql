-- name: GetArtifactTransferGrantByID :one
-- Unscoped by project_id, unlike GetArtifactTransferGrant above — used only
-- by S16's multipart continuation endpoints (part presign, complete,
-- abort), which must distinguish "grant does not exist" (404) from "grant
-- exists but belongs to a different project" (403 AccessDenied): the
-- plan's own S16 acceptance criterion ("a part call with another project's
-- grant returns 403") requires exactly that distinction, which a
-- project-scoped WHERE clause can't make — a wrong project and a
-- nonexistent id both return zero rows. See handler.go's
-- requireOwnedMultipartGrant for where the 403 decision actually happens.

-- name: MarkArtifactTransferGrantConsumed :execrows
-- consumed_at IS NULL in the WHERE clause, not just the SET, is the actual
-- single-use enforcement: 0 rows affected means either the grant does not
-- exist or was already consumed. The caller (commitTransferGrant) has
-- already fetched the row by this point, so 0 rows here unambiguously means
-- "already consumed" — see repository.go's MarkTransferGrantConsumed.
-- S16 also uses this to mark an aborted multipart grant terminal — see
-- AbortMultipartUpload.

-- name: ClaimExpiredArtifactTransferGrants :many
-- Claims a bounded batch of expired, unconsumed grants for the retention
-- sweeper, and returns what it needs to reclaim the bytes.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS. CreateArtifactTransferGrant hands out a presigned PUT and
-- writes only this row. The elitea_storage.objects row appears at commit and
-- nowhere else. A caller who uploads to the signed URL and never commits
-- therefore leaves bytes with no metadata row: SumArtifactProjectBytes cannot
-- count them against max_total_bytes, and ListExpiredArtifactObjects cannot
-- see them, because both read only the objects table. Nothing time-driven
-- reclaimed them.
--
-- WHY IT CLAIMS INSTEAD OF SELECTING. Setting consumed_at in the same
-- statement that selects the row is what makes the sweep safe against a
-- commit in flight. MarkArtifactTransferGrantConsumed already carries
-- `AND consumed_at IS NULL`, so a commit that races a claimed grant loses the
-- mark and answers 409. A plain SELECT followed by a delete has the opposite
-- outcome. The commit writes a metadata row. The sweeper then deletes the
-- bytes underneath it. The project is charged for an object that no longer
-- exists, and no later sweep can heal that.
--
-- FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED lets two replicas sweep at the same time without
-- either waiting on the other. The row itself is kept, not deleted, so a late
-- commit still sees the 409 rather than a 404.
