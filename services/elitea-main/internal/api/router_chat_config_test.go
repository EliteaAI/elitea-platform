// `GET /api/v2/elitea_core/chat_config/prompt_lib/{projectID}` is what
// `apps/elitea-web/src/features/artifacts/api/chatConfigApi.ts` calls on every
// artifacts page load. Its only registration used to be the prototype
// eliteacore handler behind the never-assigned `ChatService` gate, so it
// answered 404 in every deployment — and it had to be mounted by
// mountReviewedProductionRoutes (production_router.go), the single
// registration source newProductionRouter calls (#243), for it to be reached
// by the router main.go actually builds (#194, same class as #152).
//
// Asserted structurally (chi.Walk) rather than by driving a request: the defect
// is "this pattern is not registered", and a request would additionally have to
// clear the route's own auth+RBAC chain, which is a different contract already
// covered in internal/api/v2/promptcontextreads.
