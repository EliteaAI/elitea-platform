// The S3-shaped bucket listing is the one artifact route that names its
// project in a QUERY parameter rather than a path segment, because that is
// the SDK's fixed wire format. A query parameter is caller-controlled input,
// so the danger is specific and worth its own tests: that this route becomes
// a way to read another tenant's artifacts by editing a query string.
//
// Route shape and RBAC-tier coverage live in router_security_test.go, where
// this route is a row in artifactRoutePermissions (401 unauthenticated, 403
// without the view permission) and in artifactSuccessCases (a genuine 200 at
// its real path). What follows is the cross-tenant guarantee those tables
// cannot express, because they only ever name one project.
