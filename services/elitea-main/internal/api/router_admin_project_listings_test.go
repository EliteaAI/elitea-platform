// The project MEMBER listing and the project ROLE listing under /admin (#313).
//
// Both shipped with NO gate of any kind while their own writes beside them were
// gated. `coreHandler.Users` joins auth_core__project_user_role for whatever
// project the {projectID} segment names and answers with every member's EMAIL,
// name and roles, so any authenticated principal — a PAT holder included —
// could enumerate any project's membership by editing one path segment.
//
// EACH LISTING IS REGISTERED TWICE, and this file is about the pair. The two
// registrations run the same handler and differ only in the gate:
//
//	GET /api/v2/admin/users/{mode}/{projectID}           DEFAULT mode
//	GET /api/v2/admin/users/administration/{projectID}   ADMINISTRATION mode
//	GET /api/v2/admin/roles/{mode}/{projectID}           DEFAULT mode
//	GET /api/v2/admin/roles/administration/{projectID}   ADMINISTRATION mode
//
// The default-mode pair serves the project settings page, whose caller is a
// member. The administration pair serves the admin panel's project member
// dialog and activity drawer, whose caller is an operator who is a member of
// nothing — legacyrbac resolves a default-mode gate purely from membership of
// the named project, so the default-mode gate alone refuses every legitimate
// caller of that dialog.
//
// WHY THE STATIC REGISTRATION IS LOAD-BEARING, not decorative. chi falls
// through to the `{mode}` route for a method the static node does not carry.
// Before this change the static `administration` node held POST and PUT only,
// so a GET to `/admin/users/administration/41` was served by the `{mode}` route.
// Registering the default-mode gate there WITHOUT adding a static GET would
// therefore have moved the admin panel's read onto the membership-shaped
// resolver and broken the dialog. `TestAdminProjectListingsRegisterBothModes`
// is what fails if the static registration is dropped in a rebase.
//
// The three project-scoped claims for the DEFAULT-mode pair — refuse another
// project, refuse an under-privileged member, admit an entitled one — are made
// by router_elitea_core_project_scope_test.go, whose table carries both rows.
// This file covers what that table cannot express: the administration pair,
// which resolves centrally rather than against {projectID}.
