// The admin Service Descriptors surface (unit A14, issue #200) — asserted on the
// ROUTER, because the two defects this port fixes are both route-shaped and the
// handler tests in internal/api/v2/eliteacore mount a router of their own.
//
//  1. The listing was `GET /api/v2/elitea_core/admin/{mode}`, so a caller could
//     name any mode and get the same three invented rows back. pylon registers
//     `mode_handlers = {'administration': AdminAPI}` and nothing else, and a
//     static segment is also what keeps the handler from having to sniff a
//     `{mode}` param that a static segment does not bind — the trap #207 caught.
//  2. The two registration verbs had NO route at all. `RegisterDescriptor` was a
//     handler answering `{"ok": true}` to a discarded body, reachable from
//     nowhere. Registering them is what makes the refusal explicit and pinned; a
//     404 leaves the next person free to wire the stub back up.
//
// The route set is compared as a SET, in both directions — what must be present
// and what must be absent. A conflict resolution that added the `administration`
// registration while leaving `{mode}` behind would pass a presence-only check
// and still restore defect 1.

// TestServiceDescriptorRoutesAreGatedOnTheRouter — the middleware, not the

//
// The caller must be AUTHENTICATED for this to discriminate. Without a session
// the outer auth middleware answers 401 whether or not the route has its own
// gate, so the first version of this test passed against a router with every
// `.With(central(…))` removed. `AUTH_DEV_MODE=true` supplies a principal, and
// this router has no pool — so `legacyrbac` resolves no permissions and a gated
// route answers 403 while an ungated one reaches the handler and answers its
// unconditional 501. That is the whole discrimination:
//
//	gated   → 403
//	ungated → 501
//
// It is the assertion that fails if a conflict resolution re-adds these routes
// without their gate, which is exactly how an admin surface silently opens.
