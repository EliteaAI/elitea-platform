// llm_proxy_status.go — `GET /api/v2/admin/gateway/status`, the admin-side
// read of what the LLM gateway is actually enforcing.
//
// ## Why this route exists
//
// The gateway serves `GET /governance/status`, and that route was built to
// answer the one question the authoring surface cannot:
// *is the rule I saved in force?* The authoring table says what was written;
// the gateway's snapshot says what loaded. The three differences between them —
// a row that was REJECTED, a row that parsed but is INERT, and a snapshot that
// is STALE because refreshes are failing — are invisible from the table, and
// each one means an operator believes a ceiling is applied when it is not.
//
// Until now nothing could reach it. elitea-main proxies only `/llm` to the
// gateway's ClusterIP Service, so the admin SPA had no path to this route at
// all; `services/elitea-llm-gateway/DECISIONS.md` records the
// gap and defers "a proxy for it" as a separate decision. This file is that
// decision: a read-only proxy on the admin API, reusing the identical gateway
// transport the `/llm` reverse proxy and the #319 connection checker already
// use, so an operator configures the gateway hop once rather than three times.
//
// ## The body is passed through, not re-declared
//
// `Status` returns the gateway's own JSON verbatim. Re-declaring
// `governanceStatusBody` here would be a second specification of a contract the
// gateway owns — free to drift, and drifting silently, which is precisely the
// failure this route exists to expose in the governance corpus. The one thing
// this file adds is `reachable`, which the gateway cannot report about itself.
//
// ## Authorisation and safety
//
// Mounted inside the existing `/gateway` group under
// `RequireCentralPermissions("configuration.governance")` — the same boundary
// the governance CRUD it explains already sits behind. The upstream body
// carries row ids, names, types and refusal reasons only, never secret
// material or a tenant's prompt, which is what makes it safe to surface to an
// admin at all.

// maxStatusBody bounds how much of the gateway's answer is read. The real body
// is a few kilobytes of counters and refusal reasons; the cap exists so a
// misconfigured target that returns something enormous cannot be streamed into
// admin memory.

// promptly rather than waiting out.

// ErrNoGatewayStatusSource reports that no gateway address was configured, so

// GatewayStatusClient reads `GET /governance/status` from elitea-llm-gateway
// over the same mTLS-internal transport the `/llm` reverse proxy uses.
//
// No identity signature is sent, deliberately: the gateway verifies no HMAC on
// this route, unlike the `/llm` dialect routes. Signing it would imply an
// authorization the upstream does not perform, and reading as though it did is
// how a caller ends up trusting a header the other side ignores.
//
// The route is on the SAME mux and listener as `/llm` — there is only one
// (`cmd/elitea-llm-gateway/main.go`) — so what keeps it off the public edge is
// that elitea-main proxies only `/llm` to a ClusterIP Service, not a separate
// port. Mutual TLS protects the hop only where `TLSCAFile` is configured
// (`internal/server/server.go`); on a deployment that leaves it unset this route
// is reachable by anything inside the cluster. That is the same posture the
// existing `/metrics` and `/readyz` routes already have.
