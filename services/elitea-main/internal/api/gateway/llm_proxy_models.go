package gateway

// llm_proxy_models.go — the admin model catalogue, `/api/v2/admin/gateway/models`.
//
// ## What this table is, and why an admin needs to see it
//
// `gateway.gateway_models` is the cost basis for every billed LLM request. The
// gateway prices a call by looking its (provider, model_name) pair up here and
// multiplying by the quantities the provider reported.
//
// A pair with NO ROW is not refused, and — for a token model — is not free
// either. `internal/cost` falls back to a pylon-parity prefix table and, failing
// that, to a flat 1.0/3.0 USD per 1M tokens (`cost.go` Price, `default_prices.go`
// defaultPrice). So the call IS billed, the budget counter IS incremented, and a
// ceiling CAN stop it — but every one of those numbers is an invention. The
// failure is silent and it is a WRONG BILL, not a missing one, which is harder
// to notice and harder to reconstruct after the fact.
//
// Audio is the exception and it is the stricter one. A per-second or
// per-character rate is never fabricated, deliberately: an invented figure for a
// second of speech would land on the same counter the budget gate reads back.
// A model with no catalogue audio rate is genuinely UNPRICED — billed zero,
// counted on `gateway_audio_unpriced_total`, and stoppable by no budget at all.
//
// Both cases are the same operator action: put a row here. They are reported
// differently because the consequence differs, and an operator who is told
// "billed at zero" about a token model will go looking for missing spend that
// is in fact present and wrong.
//
// The table is populated by the scheduler's price-sync worker from public
// sources. Nothing has ever been able to read it from an admin screen, and
// nothing has ever been able to correct it. Both are this file.
//
// ## Prices are per 1M tokens, everywhere, without exception
//
// Every price column here is denominated per 1M tokens (per 1M seconds or
// characters for the audio columns 0086 added). The gateway's cost calculator
// divides by the same 1M. Accepting a per-1k number into one of these fields is
// a 1000x costing error that no test would catch and that design-bifrost-gateway
// §7.3 exists to warn about, so the field labels state the denomination and
// this file never converts.
//
// ## An override is a real override
//
// Writing a price here would be pointless on its own: price-sync UPSERTs on the
// same unique key and its DO UPDATE reassigns every price column. Shared
// migration 0095 adds `price_overridden`, and the syncer's DO UPDATE now
// carries `WHERE NOT gateway_models.price_overridden`. So a row this surface
// authors is one the sync declines to touch, and a row it has not authored
// continues to track upstream exactly as before.
//
// That is also why there is a `DELETE` and why it is described as "revert":
// clearing the override does not delete the price, it hands the row back to the
// sync, which will refresh it on its next tick.
//
// ## Usage is reported beside the catalogue, from a different table
//
// `gateway.llm_usage_events` holds one row per billed request — provider,
// model, tokens, `api_requests`, `cost_usd`, `occurred_at`. Joining it to the
// catalogue answers the question that makes the catalogue actionable: which
// models are actually being called, and is the one costing the most priced at
// all. It is deliberately a REPORT and never a second source of truth: no
// budget decision reads it, and this surface does not write it.
