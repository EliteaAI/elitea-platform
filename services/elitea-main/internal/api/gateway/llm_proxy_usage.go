// llm_proxy_usage.go — the platform-wide usage report,
// `GET /api/v2/admin/gateway/usage`.
//
// ## What this is, and which LiteLLM screen it replaces
//
// LiteLLM's admin UI had a Usage page: spend over time, a per-model table,
// per-key and per-team breakdowns, token and request counts. When ADR-0015
// replaced LiteLLM with `services/elitea-llm-gateway`, the whole of it went with
// it, and migration 0084 recorded the loss in its own header — "the accumulator
// holds money per (scope, scope_id, period) and nothing else … so the port of
// that page has a meter and nothing else". `gateway.llm_usage_events` is the
// per-request ledger 0084 added to fix that, one row per BILLED request with
// provider, model, tokens, `api_requests` and `cost_usd`.
//
// Two surfaces read it. `internal/api/v2/budgets` answers the PROJECT-scoped
// question ("what has this project spent, and against what limit") for the
// product's own Settings → Usage. This file answers the PLATFORM one, which has
// no other home: what is this deployment spending in total, on which providers
// and models, and which projects and members account for it. That question is
// the reason an operator opens an admin panel, and until now the only answer
// available anywhere was a per-project bar the operator had to visit one project
// at a time to read.
//
// ## It is a REPORT, never a second source of truth
//
// The same rule the model catalogue states: no budget decision reads this, and
// nothing here writes. Summing this ledger and `gateway.llm_budget_accumulators`
// together would double-count, and nothing does. What the two are allowed to
// disagree about is bounded — the ledger is written in the same transaction as
// the accumulator UPSERT — but they answer different questions and this endpoint
// never presents one as the other.
//
// ## Retention bounds what any window could ever show
//
// The scheduler prunes the ledger on its write-back loop
// (`budgetwriteback.RetentionWindow`, 400 days), so the response carries
// `retention_days`. Every window offered here is far inside it — see
// usageRetentionDays for why the field is published regardless.
//
// ## Every failure is reported, never swallowed
//
// Each of the four sections is its own statement and its own error field, for
// the reason `ListModels` separates its unpriced report: a section that failed
// renders exactly like a section with nothing in it, and "no spend" is the
// reassuring reading an operator would take from an empty usage table. The
// totals are the one part whose failure refuses the whole response, because
// every other number on the screen is a share of them.
