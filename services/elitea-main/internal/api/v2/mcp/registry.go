// # What these two endpoints are
//
// They are NOT this platform listing its own tools — that is the MCP server in
// server.go. They are the REVERSE direction: a listing of MCP servers that have
// been registered INTO a project, and a way to invoke a tool on one of them.
//
// The Python execution worker reads the listing to build an agent's MCP tools
// (`elitea_sdk/runtime/clients/client.py:get_mcp_toolkits`). Until issue 335
// this service answered 501, so the hybrid edge sent that call to pylon and an
// agent with an MCP toolkit could not run without pylon.
//
// # Why the listing can now be served
//
// pylon's store is process memory: two dictionaries in
// `utils/mcp_servers_storage.py`, filled over socket.io and swept when a socket
// goes away. There was no table behind it, in pylon or here.
//
// There is one now — `elitea_mcp.registered_servers` and
// `elitea_mcp.registered_tools`, shared migration 0073, read and written by
// `internal/mcpregistry`. The write happens when the platform discovers a
// remote MCP server's tools over the streamable-HTTP transport, which is the
// `mcp_sync_tools` path in `internal/api/v2/eliteacore`. So the same service
// that answers this read owns the write.
//
// # Both mode shapes are served
//
// pylon's `api_tools.with_modes` registers a route both with and without the
// mode segment, so `/tools_list/1` and `/tools_list/default/1` are the same
// endpoint. The SDK builds the mode-less form
// (`client.py:105`), and the hybrid edge matches the mode-less form as well.
// Registering only `/default/` would leave the caller that actually exists
// unserved, so both are registered in `internal/api/router.go`.
//
// # An empty list is now a fact about rows
//
// It was not before. `[]` asserts "no MCP server is registered in this
// project", and while the only store was a dictionary in another process this
// service had no way to know that. Now the claim is a read of its own table, so
// a project with no registered server correctly gets `[]` rather than an error.
//
// # tools_call still refuses, and the reason is different from before
//
// See ToolsCall.

// ToolsCall serves `POST /elitea_core/tools_call/default/{projectID}`.

// It still refuses, and the reason has changed. Before issue 335 both endpoints
// refused because nothing in this stack held the data. The listing now has a
// table, so that half is served. The call does not follow, for two reasons that
// are not "no time":
//
//  1. A call to a remote MCP server carries the headers that authenticate it.
//     This service does not store them, and it must not: bearer credentials do
//     not enter this corpus (AGENTS.md). Dispatching without them would reach
//     every server that needs no authentication and fail on every server that
//     does, which is a worse contract than refusing.
//  2. A server that an Elitea MCP CLIENT hosts is reachable only down the
//     socket.io connection that registered it. This service runs no socket.io
//     server, and AGENTS.md's transport rules do not admit one.
//
// A remote MCP toolkit does not lose anything by this. The worker's remote tool
// calls its server directly over HTTP
// (`elitea_sdk/runtime/tools/mcp_remote_tool.py`) instead of asking the
// platform to relay.
//
// The body is not read. pylon validates it against `McpToolCallPostBody` before
// looking the server up, but a 400 for a malformed body would imply that a
// well-formed one would be dispatched somewhere, and none is.
