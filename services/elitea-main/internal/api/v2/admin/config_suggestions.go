// `GET /admin/plugin_config_suggestions/administration/{key}` — the choices the
// Configuration form offers for a field that declares an `enum_source`.
//
// # Why this stopped being a 501
//
// It answered "configuration value suggestions are sourced from the Pylon
// toolkit registry, which has no equivalent in this service". That was true of
// the mechanism and false of the claim underneath it. pylon reads
// `elitea_core.toolkit_schemas` — an in-process dict a plugin populates at load —
// and this service has the same registry in a better form: the digest-pinned
// snapshot in internal/runtimecomposition, generated from the exact elitea-sdk
// revision the Python workers are admitted to run. An operator picking from it
// cannot be offered a toolkit or tool name the workers would not recognise.
//
// The 501 was load-bearing while it was true, because the reason it gave was
// also the reason the only sections declaring an `enum_source` were unavailable.
// Guardrails is now live, and a form that offers three free-text boxes where the
// reference offers pickers is a worse port than one that answers this route.
//
// # The response shape
//
// `{"values": [...], "labels": {...}}`. Before A14 this route answered a BARE
// ARRAY, so `admin_ui`'s `SchemaField.jsx` — which reads `data.values` and
// `data.labels` — got `undefined` rather than an empty list. The wrapper is the
// contract; `labels` is present and empty because the identifiers ARE the
// display text for these two sources, and inventing prettified labels would
// print something the operator cannot type back into a config file.
