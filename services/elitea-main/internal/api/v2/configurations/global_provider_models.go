// global_provider_models.go serves POST
// /api/v2/admin/gateway/providers/{configID}/models: the model ids a SAVED
// platform credential can see at its provider.
//
// # Why this route exists
//
// It is the read half of the `import_llm_models` successor. Legacy imported
// from LiteLLM's own model table; there is no such table under Bifrost, so the
// provider's own listing is the inventory — see provider_model_listing.go for
// the whole argument.
//
// The write half is NOT here, deliberately. This route answers with names; the
// admin panel then creates each adopted model through the existing platform
// model surface (`POST /admin/gateway/platform_models`, global_models.go),
// which is the one place that derives a model's `section`, validates its
// credential link against the platform's own providers, and runs provider
// admission for `status_ok`. A bulk writer here would be a second author of
// those rows, and the two would then have to agree about all of it forever —
// which is the argument global_providers.go's own header makes for delegating
// its writes.
//
// # The credential is never re-typed and never returned
//
// The row is read server-side and resolved through the SAME
// StoredConfigurationResolver the stored connection check consumes
// (stored_check.go, which this file does not modify). That is what makes the
// route possible at all: a platform credential's api_key is sealed in the
// public project's vault, so an operator holding `configuration.governance`
// has no copy of it to send. The resolved payload goes to the gateway and is
// dropped; no branch here logs it, returns it, or persists it.
//
// # What it must NOT do
//
//   - It must NOT write. Reading a provider's catalogue is not a decision to
//     adopt any of it, and a route that silently created rows would be the
//     legacy task's own failure mode: a scheduled import that published models
//     nobody chose, into every project on the platform.
//   - It must NOT dial the provider. The gateway owns the SSRF-safe egress
//     allowlist (#13); this handler reaches it through the same client the
//     stored check uses.
//   - It must NOT report an empty list for a failure. "This provider offers no
//     models" and "the listing could not be read" are different facts, and the
//     first is the one an operator would act on.
