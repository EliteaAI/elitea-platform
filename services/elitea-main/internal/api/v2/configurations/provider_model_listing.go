// provider_model_listing.go is elitea-main's half of the successor to
// legacy's `import_llm_models`.
//
// # What legacy did, and what replaced it
//
// The legacy admin task read LiteLLM's own model table (`model_info`) and
// wrote a Configuration row for every entry it found that this platform did
// not already manage
// (legacy/plugins/runtime_interface_litellm/methods/admin_tasks.py).
//
// Bifrost keeps no such table, so there is no registry to reconcile against
// and no honest way to resurrect that task as written. What is still there is
// the authority the registry was only ever a cache of: the PROVIDER's own
// model listing, reachable with the credential the operator already stored.
//
// The gateway speaks those dialects already — its connection checkers call
// GET /models, GET /openai/deployments, GET /api/tags, Bedrock's
// ListFoundationModels and Vertex's Model Garden listing, and discard the
// body. `POST /llm/v1/list_provider_models` makes the same call and keeps the
// ids. This file is the client for it.
//
// # Why the round trip stays in the gateway
//
// For the reason check_connection.go states at length: the gateway owns the
// SSRF-safe egress allowlist for a tenant-authored `api_base` (#13), and
// elitea-main must not reach the same provider a second, unguarded way. The
// listing route reuses the checkers' own `dialTargets`, allowlist gate and
// address-validating dialer, so this is not a second path to a provider — it
// is the same path with the answer kept.
