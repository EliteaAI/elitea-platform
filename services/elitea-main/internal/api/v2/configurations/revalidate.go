// revalidate.go implements POST /revalidate/[{mode}/]{projectID}/{configID}:
// re-run the ADMISSION decision for one stored row and persist its status_ok.
//
// # Admission is not a provider contact, and that is why this is its own route
//
// status_ok answers "may a runtime use this row" — its declared references
// expand, its hidden secrets redeem, and policy admits the project to own it.
// Nothing in that decision dials a provider; the baseline platform set the
// column from its own events too (application/configurations/provider_admission.go
// records the two Python call sites). The LIVE provider round trip is the
// separate, user-started check in stored_check.go, and it stores NOTHING.
//
// Merging the two would break both halves:
//
//   - A provider outage would flip status_ok to false for every credential in
//     the project, withdrawing rows the gateway was serving correctly, because
//     every reader of a provider row selects on status_ok = true.
//   - A row whose secret no longer redeems would keep status_ok = true as long
//     as the provider still answered a key the platform can no longer read.
//
// So: this route writes the column and never dials; the stored check dials and
// never writes. The comment is here, and in stored_check.go, so a later edit
// that "simplifies" the pair into one route has to delete a stated reason.
//
// # Why the route exists at all
//
// Admission runs when a row is WRITTEN (provider_admission.go, #457). Nothing
// re-runs it afterwards, and the inputs are not owned by the row: the
// credential it references can be deleted, renamed, or have its vault secret
// removed. status_ok then describes a row that no longer resolves, and the
// only repair available to a user was to open the credential and save it
// again — a write, with all a write's risks, to fix a status column.
//
// # What it writes
//
// EXACTLY what Update writes, through the same function: admitConfiguration,
// which writes status_ok and nothing else. No field of the row is touched — no
// data, no meta, no updated_at. status_logs is deliberately NOT written: the
// admission decision carries no message (CurrentProviderAdmissionDecision is
// {Managed, StatusOK}), the lifecycle's own status effect writes status_ok
// alone as well (repos.SetCurrentConfigurationLifecycleStatus), and inventing
// a log line here would make this route the only writer of a column two other
// paths leave alone. The stored value is read back and returned unchanged.
//
// An UNMANAGED row — a generic SDK configuration, or an imported model with no
// ai_credentials — is left exactly as it is: admitConfiguration returns the
// stored value when the decision reports Managed = false, so this route cannot
// change the status of a row whose status it does not own.
