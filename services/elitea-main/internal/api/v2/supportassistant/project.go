package supportassistant

// The HIDDEN SUPPORT PROJECT: how it is resolved, how it is created, and how a
// user comes to hold a role in it.
//
// The reference does all three in `module.py` at plugin load: `ready()` calls
// `_ensure_support_project()`, which creates the project once and memoises the
// id in `descriptor.state`. That shape does not survive here, for two reasons
// worth stating rather than working around silently:
//
//   - THERE IS NO SINGLE PROCESS. This service runs as N replicas, and a
//     create-if-missing at boot in N processes creates up to N projects. The
//     bootstrap below runs under a Postgres advisory lock keyed on this feature
//     and RE-READS the stored id inside the lock, so the second replica through
//     finds the first one's project instead of making its own.
//
//   - IT IS LAZY, NOT AT BOOT. A boot-time create would run on every deployment
//     of every operator who has never enabled the assistant, and would make this
//     service's startup depend on the provisioning pipeline. It runs on the
//     first support request after an operator turns the switch on, which is the
//     first moment the project is actually needed.

// Provisioner is the project-create pipeline, narrowed to the one call this
// package makes. It is satisfied by
// `internal/application/projectprovisioning.Provisioner`.
//
// It is an INTERFACE rather than a direct import so that this package can be
// tested without a provisioning pipeline, and so a deployment that wires no
// provisioner degrades to "operator must name an existing project" instead of
// failing to build.

// SupportProjectName is the name the hidden project is created with, verbatim

// SystemUserEmail owns the hidden project, matching the reference's
// `system_user = "system@centry.user"`. This is the PLATFORM system identity,
// which `internal/api/v2/admin/users.go`'s `systemUserPredicate` already knows
// to hide from the admin user listing — so the support project's owner does not
// appear as a mysterious extra person on that page.

// ErrNoProvisioner is returned when the assistant is enabled, no project id has
// been stored, and no provisioner is wired. It is not surfaced to a caller: the

// against one project and executed against another is the whole class of bug
// this package's server-side resolution exists to make impossible.
