// The provider ADMISSION plane behind the three service-descriptor routes
// (ADR-0012 phase P3, migration 0107).
//
// WHAT CHANGED, AND WHAT DID NOT. These routes answered 501 because there was
// no store — see service_descriptors.go's header for the full account. There is
// one now, so they answer honestly instead of refusing. What has NOT changed is
// what this deployment can do: it can RECORD a provider and SHOW it, and it
// still cannot ACTIVATE one, because activation requires a policy overlay
// nothing here can issue. That limit is a database constraint
// (provider_admitted_revision_active_needs_overlay), not a branch in this file,
// so it cannot be lifted by editing Go.
//
// THREE CONTRACT DECISIONS, each chosen against the shape this replaces:
//
//   * `healthy` is a THREE-STATE value: true, false, or null. Null means no
//     probe has reported inside the freshness window. Pylon's page could only
//     say true or false, because its value was which in-process dict an entry
//     landed in — so a provider nobody had probed appeared unhealthy, and an
//     operator could not tell that from one that had actually failed.
//
//   * Registration answers 202, not 200. The descriptor is recorded and is NOT
//     in force: 200 would say the provider is admitted, which is the thing this
//     deployment cannot do. The body carries the revision id, the manifest
//     digest, the status and the reason, so a caller learns what happened
//     rather than being told `{"ok": true}` — which is what the handler this
//     replaces returned, without storing anything.
//
//   * DELETE REVOKES; it never deletes a row. An admission that was once in
//     force is a fact about what this deployment ran, and an audit that can be
//     erased by the surface it audits is not one.
