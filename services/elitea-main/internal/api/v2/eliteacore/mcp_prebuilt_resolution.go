// Resolution of the PRE-BUILT MCP server catalogue into a request's settings.
//
// This is the read half of shared migration 0092. The catalogue is defined by
// an operator through `internal/api/v2/admin/mcp_prebuilt.go`; this file is
// what makes a definition do something, by filling the fields a pre-built MCP
// toolkit leaves for the platform to supply.
//
// # The call sites are pylon's, and two of the five have a Go counterpart
//
// pylon resolves in five places. Two are wired here:
//
//	mcp_sync_tools.py:81   → MCPSyncTools    (fills url, headers, timeout)
//	mcp_oauth_proxy.py:112 → MCPOAuthProxy   (fills client_id, client_secret)
//
// The other three are NOT wired, and neither is an omission:
//
//   - `toolkit_discover_tools.py:72` injects a catalogue URL into an OUTBOUND
//     discovery, because pylon's route dispatches `discover_mcp_tools` over RPC
//     to indexer_worker. The Go route of that name is a different thing
//     entirely: `toolkits.pgRepo.DiscoverTools` is a SELECT over the project's
//     own `elitea_tools` rows of a given type. It makes no outbound call, so
//     there is nothing for a URL to point at, and injecting one would be a
//     setting no code reads.
//   - `internal_tools.py:531,550,730` build an agent's tools at execution time.
//     That belongs to the Python execution worker's side of the split and has
//     no Go counterpart to wire.
//
// The MCP discovery this service really performs is `MCPSyncTools`, and that is
// where the catalogue reaches it.
//
// # Why a failure is never silent here
//
// A catalogue read that fails is NOT treated as "no catalogue entry". The two
// have opposite consequences: no entry means the caller's own settings stand,
// while an unreadable catalogue means an entry may exist whose credentials the
// request should have carried and now will not. The second produces an
// authentication failure at a remote server, reported to the user as the remote
// server's problem. So the resolver reports the error and its callers refuse,
// rather than proceeding with a request they know is under-configured.
