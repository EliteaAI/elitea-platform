// # Amount redaction
//
// A member who is neither a project admin nor the owner of the personal project
// being reported on does not see platform cost figures. They receive the SAME
// payload with the money fields removed and `can_see_amounts: false`;
// percentages, thresholds and the period are still there, so the usage bar
// still renders. This is the reference's rule, kept because it is the one the
// deployment's users have been operating under.
//
// The removal happens on the assembled payload rather than by never fetching
// the numbers, exactly as the reference does — one code path produces the
// figures, one step decides who sees them, so the two cannot disagree about
// what a redacted field is.
//
// # The dimensional views
//
// The per-day series, the per-model table and the token totals come from
// gateway.llm_usage_events (issue #320) and are assembled in
// usage_dimensions.go. They are ABSENT, not empty arrays, when the ledger holds
// nothing for the scope — see the package doc for why an empty array is a
// different and wrong claim.
//
// The per-day and per-model SPEND figures are money, so they are redacted for a
// caller who may not see amounts. The token and request counts are not: a
// member is allowed to know how much they used, on the same principle that
// leaves them the percentage and the period.
