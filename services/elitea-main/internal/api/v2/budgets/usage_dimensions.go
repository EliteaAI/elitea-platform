// The dimensional half of the usage report (issue #320).
//
// LiteLLM kept a per-tag daily ledger and legacy read it: usage.py assembled a
// daily breakdown and a per-model breakdown carrying spend, total_tokens and
// api_requests, and the Settings → Usage screen drew both plus the token
// columns and an Excel export. The Go port had a meter and nothing else,
// because the write-back path persisted one accumulated USD figure per scope
// and period and there was no ledger behind it.
//
// gateway.llm_usage_events is that ledger. These reads aggregate it; they never
// price anything and never estimate a token. Every figure here is a sum of
// values the provider reported and the gateway billed.
//
// # Why these numbers cannot double-count the accumulator
//
// They are the same money, aggregated two ways from one delta. The gateway
// publishes ONE delta per (request, scope); the write-back consumer folds its
// nano-USD into the accumulator and, inside the same dedup gate, appends one
// ledger row under the same event id. A request that bills both the project and
// the member scope publishes two deltas and only the project one carries
// dimensions, so the ledger holds one row per request, not two.
//
// So SUM(cost_usd) over a period equals that period's project accumulator, and
// nothing anywhere adds the two together. The accumulator remains the only
// table a budget decision reads.
