// The DeepWiki hop clears the per-connection write deadline before streaming.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE TEST FROM providerhost/hop's OWN. That package's test proves
// ClearWriteDeadline works in isolation. It cannot prove this hop CALLS it —
// and this hop did not, for as long as it has existed, while the /llm hop
// always did. A helper nobody calls is the shape this repository's wiring
// tests exist for.
//
// It is LATENT today: cmd/elitea-main's server sets ReadHeaderTimeout and
// IdleTimeout and no WriteTimeout, so nothing currently truncates a long
// response. This test is what makes adding one later safe — without it, a
// perfectly reasonable "add a WriteTimeout" change would cut generation
// results off mid-stream on this hop only, with no error anywhere and a
// client that just sees the stream stop.
