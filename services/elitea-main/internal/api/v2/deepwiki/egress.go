// DeepWiki's half of the git-host egress control (ADR-0022 decision 6): the
// variable an operator sets, and nothing else.
//
// The matching rules moved to internal/providerhost/material with the rest of
// the rewrite mechanics, because Inventory needs the same control over its own
// source repositories and a second copy of the `*.` subdomain rule is a second
// place for the two halves to drift from the provider's Python check. What
// stays here is the NAME: one allowlist variable per app, so a deployment can
// let DeepWiki clone from a host Inventory may not.

// clone time.
