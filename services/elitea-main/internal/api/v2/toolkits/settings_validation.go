// ToolkitSettingsValidator resolves one toolkit's settings against the saved
// configuration rows the CALLER can see, without redeeming any secret.
//
// It exists because nothing on the toolkit write path used to resolve a
// credential at all: Create checked that a `github` toolkit named SOME
// `github_configuration` key and Update checked nothing, so a toolkit could be
// saved pointing at a credential that lives in another project, or at one that
// does not exist anywhere. The reference was then read for the first time at
// chat time, where the failure aborts the whole agent turn
// (internal/application/agentexecution/tools.go's unsupportedStartBecause) —
// far from the screen that caused it and with no field to point at.
//
// The one implementation is *configurationapp.CurrentToolkitSettingsResolver in
// CurrentToolkitSettingsReferenceMode, the SAME resolver and the same mode that
// index admission and agent-version freezing already run
// (internal/runtimecomposition/{index,agent}_runtime.go). The interface is
// declared here, consumer-side, for the reason ToolkitArgumentSchemaSource
// above gives: internal/runtimecomposition imports this package, so this
// package cannot import it back.
//
// A nil validator accepts every CREDENTIAL REFERENCE unresolved, which is the
// previous behaviour. That is what a deployment with
// ELITEA_CONFIGURATIONS_ENABLED unset gets, because the collaborator graph this
// resolver needs is composed only inside that flag (cmd/elitea-main/main.go).
//
// It is NOT a full bypass of the write path: refuseFrozenConfigurationMarker
// runs whether or not this is assigned, because that refusal needs no
// collaborator — see its own comment.

// refuseUnresolvableToolkitSettings resolves the settings a write is about to
// persist and answers the request itself when they cannot be resolved. It
// reports whether it wrote a response; true means the caller must stop.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO:
//
//   - It never persists the resolver's OUTPUT. Reference mode returns the
//     configuration EXPANDED and stamped with CurrentFrozenConfigurationMarker
//     (toolkit_settings.go), and writing that into elitea_tools.settings would
//     replace a live reference with a frozen snapshot and forge a vault owner
//     through configuration_project_id — precisely what that marker's own doc
//     comment warns against. Only the error is used; the body is persisted
//     unchanged. Pinned by
//     TestAnAcceptedSavePersistsTheRequestSettingsByteForByte here and by the
//     accepted-save assertion in
//     internal/api/toolkit_credential_admission_postgres_integration_test.go:
//     turning the discard into a copy-back left every other test green.
//   - It never refuses an ABSENT credential. Reference mode rewrites a
//     missing/null/false configuration field to `{}` and moves on, because an
//     anonymous OpenAPI toolkit is a legitimate save. A green save with no
//     credential is therefore NOT evidence that this gate failed to run.
//   - It never refuses on CurrentToolkitSecretNotSealedCode. That code fires on
//     a schema-declared `secret` field whose stored value is not yet a vault
//     reference — a property of rows that predate save-time vault wrapping, not
//     of the edit being made. Refusing it here would make an already-stored
//     toolkit of one of the ten affected SDK types (aws, azure, azure_search,
//     elastic, gcp, keycloak, kubernetes, yagmail, zephyr, zephyr_squad)
//     impossible to edit at all, including impossible to fix. The runtime
//     already fails closed on it.
//   - It never refuses an UNKNOWN toolkit type. `database`, `custom`,
//     `datasource` and every `*_loader` are served by the create form and are
//     absent from the pinned SDK snapshot, so the resolver answers
//     ErrCurrentToolkitSchemaNotFound for them. Refusing on that would make
//     most of the create form unusable.
//
// WHICH PRINCIPALS IT VALIDATES. The resolver refuses a non-positive UserID
// outright, so the gate can only run for a principal auth.User.OwningUserID can
// name — and OwningUserID returns positiveID(u.UserID) FIRST, whenever UserID is
// set at all (internal/auth/types.go). Every production authentication path sets
// it to a positive numeric id, including both token paths:
//
//   - the edge's forwarded identity sets UserID from X-Auth-ID for
//     `X-Auth-Type: user` and from X-Auth-User-ID for `X-Auth-Type: token`
//     (internal/api/middleware/auth.go's tryTraefikHeaders);
//   - direct PAT validation sets ID, UserID and TokenID from the token row, and
//     refuses the row outright unless both ids are positive
//     (internal/infra/authsvc/local_validator.go);
//   - a session cookie sets UserID from a `uid` claim it has already checked is
//     a positive integer (verifySessionCookie).
//
// So a PAT-driven save IS validated, against the TOKEN OWNER's credential
// visibility. That is the correct principal: the configuration rows a PAT may
// reference are its owner's, and the same UserID is what index admission and
// agent freezing resolve against.
//
// NO PRINCIPAL CLASS TAKES THE SKIP TODAY. It remains for the cases where this
// gate genuinely has nothing to resolve against: no auth.User in the request
// context at all, an id outside int32, and a projectID that is not a positive
// tenant-shaped integer. The (0,false) arm of OwningUserID needs an auth.User
// that is a token AND has no UserID, and the one writer that could produce it
// is the Pylon Redis RPC client (internal/infra/authsvc/rpc.go), which copies
// user_id straight from the response without checking it — and which has no
// non-test caller (the same latency internal/api/middleware/project.go's
// project-by-name note records). A hybrid deployment that composes that client
// would make the arm live, and the skip is what keeps it from validating
// against the wrong user when it does.
//
// Substituting the "1" that Create defaults userID to would validate against
// USER 1's credential visibility instead of the caller's, which is worse than
// not validating: it would admit a credential the caller cannot see and refuse
// one they can.

// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN REFUSAL AND NOT A SILENT STRIP. The marker means "this
// object was expanded from a saved configuration by ReferenceMode, and the
// configuration_project_id beside it names the vault that owns its secrets"
// (toolkit_settings.go). Claim-time materialization requires it before it will
// treat a stored object as a frozen configuration and read that owner
// (currentFrozenConfigurationOwner in
// internal/infra/storage/configurations_materializer.go). A request body that
// supplies it is therefore attempting to forge a vault owner, which is the one
// thing the resolver rejects the key to prevent — and before this refusal
// existed, such a body was persisted verbatim.
//
// Stripping the key instead would silently accept the rest of a body written to
// exploit it and leave no trace on the screen or in the log. Refusing says what
// happened, and no legitimate client writes this key: the web credential picker
// stores exactly `{elitea_title, private}` (credentialPicker.tsx's
// toStoredValue), and the marker's own namespace prefix exists so it cannot
// collide with a schema field.
//
// The message NAMES the key. It is an exported constant, not a secret, and a
// caller that hit this by round-tripping a materialized settings blob back into
// a save needs to know which key to drop.
//
// NO LEGITIMATE ROUND TRIP CARRIES IT, so this refuses nothing a normal edit
// does. ReferenceMode's marked output is never persisted into
// elitea_tools.settings (see refuseUnresolvableToolkitSettings' first bullet),
// claim-time materialization strips the key before the SDK sees it
// (configurations_materializer.go), and the index-meta reader already treats a
// marked pgvector_configuration in a stored toolkit as unusable
// (indexing/index_meta.go's currentIndexMetaTarget). A stored row that DOES
