// Short-lived, project-bound bearers for a provider service to call back with
// (ADR-0022 decision 6).
//
// WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN THE CALLER. Issuing a usable bearer is three
// things that must happen together: a token row, a project binding, and a
// signature made with the key THIS deployment's validator reads back. The
// route above already knows all three, including the signer-beats-raw-key rule
// that a deployment with an authentication configuration file depends on
// (signBaselineToken's header records what happened when that was wrong). A
// second implementation elsewhere would be a second place to get any of them
// wrong, and the failure mode is a token that is issued successfully and
// rejected on first use.
//
// WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM A PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN. Nothing structural —
// it is the same row and the same bearer format, which is exactly why the
// platform's own validator accepts it with no changes. What differs is how it
// is issued: never at a user's request, always with an expiry, always bound to
// one project, and named after the invocation it was minted for so an operator
// reading the token list can tell what asked for it.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. The legacy flow shipped workers a no-expiry system-user
// PAT. Anything that read one worker's environment held a credential to the
// whole platform, forever. This one expires in minutes and can only bill and
// reach the one project whose wiki is being generated.
