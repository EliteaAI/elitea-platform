// CurrentStoredConfigurationResolution resolves ONE stored configuration row
// to the plaintext payload a live provider check needs
// (internal/api/v2/configurations/stored_check.go).
//
// It is the same walk currentProviderConfigurationResolution performs, over
// the same expander and the same vault unsecreter, in the same order: redeem
// the owner's own secret references first, then expand, so each nested
// configuration resolves through ITS OWN project's vault and no cross-project
// fallback can occur. The ONE difference is the disposal of the result.
//
//	currentProviderConfigurationResolution — throws the payload away. Its
//	    question is "does this row resolve at all", and the answer is the
//	    status_ok column. Returning the plaintext there would hand every
//	    lifecycle caller a live credential it has no use for.
//
//	this type — returns the payload, to ONE caller, which forwards it to the
//	    gateway's check endpoint and drops it. That caller may not log it,
//	    persist it, or return it to the browser.
//
// The two are kept as separate types rather than one with a flag, so that the
// capability to obtain plaintext is something a composition root grants
// deliberately: a handler holding this resolver can read any credential of the
// projects it serves, and that must be visible at the wiring, not hidden in a
// boolean argument.
