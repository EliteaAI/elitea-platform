// bootstrapScope keys the advisory lock this file takes. Deliberately distinct
// from ScopeShared and ScopeTenant: it is not a history, it has no ledger and
// no checksum, and giving it their key would let a bootstrap and a shared
// migration in two different processes believe they held the same lock.
const bootstrapScope Scope = "bootstrap"

// Bootstrap applies the pylon-era schema to a database that does not carry it,
// and reports whether it did.
//
// WHY THE BINARY DOES THIS. The numbered histories cannot run against an empty
// database — shared/0030 has a foreign key to centry.project, and that table is
// created by the pylon-era schema rather than by any migration. Until this
// existed, only the compose stack and the E2E seeder could supply it, both by
// running psql against a file on disk. A Kubernetes install therefore could not
// reach a migrated database at all without a human, and the Helm chart's
// workaround was to carry its own copy of the SQL — a second source of truth
// held in step by a CI gate. Applying it here removes both.
//
// It also fixes an ownership problem that the external approaches could not.
// Whoever applies this SQL OWNS the objects it creates, and the histories then
// ALTER those objects, which PostgreSQL only allows the owner to do. Applied by
// an administrator — the only role that could, from outside — the chain died at
// shared/0041 with "must be owner of table project", and the tenant half at
// "tenant schema p_1 is not the effective schema". Applied here it runs as the
// migrating role itself, so ownership is right by construction and no hand-over
// step exists to get wrong.
//
// IDEMPOTENT, and cheap when there is nothing to do: the presence of
// centry.project is a question, not an error path — to_regclass returns NULL
// for a missing relation rather than raising — so an already-bootstrapped
// database costs one query and returns false.
//
// The whole thing runs in ONE transaction under an advisory lock, so two
// migration Jobs racing on a fresh install cannot both apply it: the loser
// blocks, then finds centry.project present and does nothing.
