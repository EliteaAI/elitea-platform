// gatewayMigrationPath is the LLM-gateway governance/budget/price-catalog
// schema (BF0.4), inside the LEDGERED corpus.
//
// It used to be a private directory under this package, applied only by
// RunMigrations — i.e. only when ELITEA_DEV_BOOTSTRAP_LEGACY_SCHEMA=true, which
// production never sets. The Helm migration hook runs elitea-migrate, which
// applies only the ledgered histories, so a Helm-deployed database never got
// these tables while three services read them (issue #306). The DDL now lives
// in migrations/shared/0067 and this file points at it, so the dev bootstrap
// and the production migration apply the exact same bytes — a second copy is
// how the two silently diverge.
const gatewayMigrationPath = "shared/0067_gateway_budget_schema.sql"

// usageDimensionsMigrationPath is the SECOND half of the gateway schema
// (issues #320/#321/#322): the per-request usage ledger, the nullable
// soft_alert_pct that lets a platform default exist, and the seeded global
// budget-alert row.
//
// It is listed beside 0067 rather than folded into it because a shipped
// migration is content-checksummed and must never be edited. Both are needed
// together: the gateway's snapshot query joins the global alert row on every
// /llm call and the write-back consumer inserts into the ledger, so a database
// carrying only 0067 answers 42P01 on the billing path.
const usageDimensionsMigrationPath = "shared/0084_budget_usage_dimensions.sql"

// audioPricesMigrationPath is the THIRD file of the gateway price catalog: the
// four per-1,000,000-unit audio price columns that /llm/v1/audio/transcriptions
// and /llm/v1/audio/speech need.
//
// It is a separate file, not an edit of 0067, because a shipped migration is
// content-checksummed and the ledger rejects any drift in it.
//
// It belongs beside the other two for the reason GatewayMigrationSQL() exists:
// four Postgres integration suites build the gateway schema from that function
// alone. A database built without this file has gateway.gateway_models with no
// audio columns, and the price read answers 42703 at request time — a runtime
// error on the billing path, not a red build.
const audioPricesMigrationPath = "shared/0086_gateway_audio_prices.sql"

// requestLogMigrationPath is the FOURTH file of the gateway schema: the
// per-request log the gateway writes for every request it serves, billed or
// not, succeeded or not.
//
// It is in this list for the reason the three above are. The log is a real
// gateway table with real readers — the admin request-log listing
// (internal/api/gateway/llm_proxy_logs.go) and the project analytics reads
// (internal/infra/db/repos/analytics.go) — so a test database that has the
// budget tables and not this one fails at query time rather than at setup,
// which is the failure mode GatewayMigrationSQL exists to prevent.
const requestLogMigrationPath = "shared/0099_gateway_request_logs.sql"

// tokenBindingMigrationPath is the access-token project binding (ADR-0018,
// spec-llm-project-scope §3), inside the LEDGERED corpus.
//
// It is here for the same reason 0067 is, and the failure it prevents is
// harder: internal/db/queries/auth_pat.sql's GetActivePATPrincipalByUUID now
// LEFT JOINs elitea_identity.token_project_binding, and that query runs for
// EVERY credential validation. A database built by this function alone would
// answer 42P01 to every token-authenticated request — not a missing feature, a
// dead API surface. RunMigrations applies migrations/*.sql plus this exempt
// list only; it never applies the ledgered shared corpus, so a file that the
// hot read path depends on must be named here.
//
// Every real deploy path (the Helm migrate-job, deploy/scripts/standalone-stack.sh,
// the hybrid POV compose) runs elitea-migrate and applies the whole ledgered
// history, so none of them need this. Only ELITEA_DEV_BOOTSTRAP_LEGACY_SCHEMA
// does.
const tokenBindingMigrationPath = "shared/0071_token_project_binding.sql"

// dumpGuardExemptMigrations are the ledgered shared files RunMigrations applies
// itself, in order. Every one of them MUST be idempotent and MUST tolerate a
// database that already holds its objects: the pool.Exec below leaves NO ledger
// row, so elitea-migrate re-applies and records them later.
//
// Add a file here when code on a read path depends on it. Do not add one for a
// feature that only the ledgered corpus needs — the list is a compatibility
// shim for one dev flag, not a second migration runner.
