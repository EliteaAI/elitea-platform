// ActorPATName is the `auth_core__token.name` this service writes when it
// issues a personal access token on a person's behalf.
//
// It is deliberately a SENTENCE and not a plausible user-chosen label. The
// token is listed on /settings/tokens next to the keys the person created
// themselves (ListOwnedPATs filters nothing), and the name is the only thing
// that tells the two apart. "api" is already taken by the per-project system
// user, so it must not be reused here either.
const ActorPATName = "Auto-issued at first sign-in (revocable)"

// EnsureActorPAT gives a freshly provisioned account the credential the agent
// runtime signs its calls with, and returns whether it had to create one.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// internal/infra/authsvc.LocalIssuer never creates, rotates or stores a PAT —
// that contract is load-bearing and is not the place for this. It RE-SIGNS an
// existing active row (GetActivePATForUser). With no row, the lookup misses,
// the miss becomes ErrTokenRejected, and the chat turn fails as
// runtimeContextUnavailable(runtimeContextStageActorPATIssuance): an error that
// names a database stage for what is really missing setup. Before this, the
// only writer of that row was the user-driven POST /api/v2/auth/token/, so a
// person who had just signed in through single sign-on could not complete a
// chat turn until they went and created a key by hand — and a fresh install
// needed deploy/scripts/standalone-stack.sh to seed one with raw SQL.
//
// # The three decisions
//
//   - NAME: ActorPATName, above. Visibly system-issued.
//   - EXPIRY: NONE. An expiring auto-issued key would break every chat turn on
//     its expiry day, with the same misleading database-stage error and nothing
//     on screen to explain it. The lifetime that actually bounds it is the
//     account: GetActivePATPrincipalByUUID joins auth_core__user and refuses a
//     suspended owner, so suspending or deleting the account revokes the key.
//   - VISIBILITY: LISTED, on /settings/tokens, and deletable there like any
//     other key. A long-lived per-user credential its owner cannot see or
//     revoke is strictly worse than one they can.
//
// # Idempotency
//
// The condition is "this account has no active PAT at all", read through the
// SAME query the issuer reads (GetActivePATForUser), not "no token named
// ActorPATName". So a person who has created their own key gets nothing extra,
// a second sign-in creates nothing, and a person who deleted every key —
// including this one — gets a working runtime back on their next sign-in
// instead of a permanently broken one.
