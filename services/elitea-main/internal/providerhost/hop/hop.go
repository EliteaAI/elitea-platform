// Package hop carries the two things every provider hop in this service does
// identically, and one of them was already being done in only one of them.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE, and why this package is small. The mTLS transport
// (llmproxy.NewMTLSTransport) and the identity signer
// (llmproxy.SignIdentityHeaders) look like the obvious contents and are
// deliberately absent: they already have THREE callers — the /llm proxy, the
// DeepWiki facade, and the provider connection check — so they are already
// extracted, into llmproxy. Moving them here would rename an import across
// three packages and change nothing. ADR-0012's plan called this package's
// subject "the ReverseProxy assembly, not the crypto", and this is what
// survives once the crypto is excluded.
//
// PROMOTION TRIGGER: a second Go MODULE needing these. Today every caller is
// inside elitea-main, so this stays internal.

// ClearWriteDeadline removes the per-connection write deadline before a hop
// streams a response.
//
// WHY EVERY HOP NEEDS IT. http.Server's WriteTimeout, when set, kills a
// long-lived response mid-stream. A generation's result and an SSE stream are
// both long-lived, and the failure is a truncated body with no error anywhere:
// the client sees a stream that simply stops.
//
// TODAY THIS IS LATENT, NOT LIVE, and it is called anyway. cmd/elitea-main's
// server sets ReadHeaderTimeout and IdleTimeout and NO WriteTimeout, so
// nothing currently kills a long response. The /llm hop has cleared the
// deadline since it was written; the DeepWiki hop never did. That difference
// is invisible until someone adds a WriteTimeout — a change that would look
// entirely reasonable, and would break one hop and not the other. Calling this
// from both is what makes them fail or survive together.
//
// A ResponseWriter that does not support deadlines (httptest.ResponseRecorder
// does not) is not an error: the deadline it cannot set is one it does not
// have.
