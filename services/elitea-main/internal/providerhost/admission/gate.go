// Package admission puts the admission plane IN FORCE on the request path.
//
// Migration 0107 and internal/providerhub gave this deployment a record of
// what it admits: the facades' registrar files an `inactive` revision at
// boot, the administration surface can revoke one, and the admin page shows
// both. NOTHING READ IT. A revoked provider kept serving every invoke, so
// the one operator action the surface offers — turn this provider off —
// changed a row and nothing else. This package is the read.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not authentication and it is not a permission: the
// routes table asks it AFTER both, and it answers a question neither of
// those can — whether THIS DEPLOYMENT still admits the provider at all. A
// caller with every grant is refused by a revocation, which is the point of
// a revocation.
//
// THE DEGRADED PATH ALLOWS, DELIBERATELY. Absence of the plane (no
// database, no public project, migration 0107 not applied) and failure to
// read it both resolve to "allow", and the second one logs. This is the
// same decision the LLM gateway made for an unreadable model set
// (services/elitea-llm-gateway/DECISIONS.md): a control that fails closed on
// its own storage turns one database blip into a total outage of every
// provider, while the thing it is protecting against — a provider an
// operator has actively revoked — is a state someone had to create on
// purpose and which the plane will report correctly again the moment it is
// readable. Refusing on absence would additionally break every deployment
// that has never migrated, which is most of them.
