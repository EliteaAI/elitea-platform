// The IN-APP SUPPORT ASSISTANT's resolved settings.
//
// It lives beside the announcements resolver for the same reason that one does:
// the writer is the admin Features page (`internal/api/v2/admin`), every reader
// is somewhere else (`internal/api/v2/supportassistant` today), and a flag whose
// only reader is the page that wrote it is the defect unit A14 was opened to
// remove. The support assistant is the sharpest example of that defect in this
// corpus — its section carried an `unavailable_reason` saying, in as many words,
// that turning the switch on "would change a flag no rendered surface reads".
//
// # Why the ids are resolved here rather than held in process state
//
// The reference keeps them in Pylon module state
// (`legacy/plugins/support_assistant/module.py`: `self._support_project_id`,
// memoised on first read and written back through `descriptor.save_state()`),
// which is why every field on that page carried `requires_restart`. There is no
// restart signal to offer here and no module state to hold, so each call reads
// the rows. That is what lets an operator point the assistant at a different
// agent and have the next message use it.
//
// # Absence is not zero
//
// `ProjectID`, `AgentProjectID` and `AgentID` are 0 when the operator has not
// chosen one, and `Values.Int` is a two-value read precisely so that 0 cannot
// arrive from a stored `0`. The distinction is load-bearing: `Ready` refuses to
// serve the assistant at all while the agent is unchosen, and a zero that looked
// like a choice would send every support conversation at whatever row id 0
// resolves to.
