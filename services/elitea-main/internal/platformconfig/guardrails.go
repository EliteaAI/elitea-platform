// LoadGuardrails resolves the `guardrails` section into a matching policy.
//
// It returns the error rather than swallowing it, and that is a deliberate
// departure from the flag readers above.
//
// Those readers degrade permissively on their own, because a database hiccup
// must not silently switch a subsystem off. Here the permissive answer is the
// UNSAFE one: an empty policy blocks nothing, so a failed read would hand back
// exactly the tools an operator disabled. The two callers want opposite things
// from that, and neither can be served by a single hidden default:
//
//   - the catalogue and form endpoints degrade permissively and say so in the
//     log. Refusing to list toolkit types because one row could not be read
//     would take the product down to enforce a policy that may well be empty.
//   - the agent tool FREEZE refuses the execution. That is the one path where
//     running unguarded means a blocked tool actually executes, and "we could
//     not read the policy" is not a reason to act as though there were none.
//
// Deciding that here would have made one of those two wrong. Callers decide.

// construct it directly from the pool it already holds: the composition root
// imports the api packages, so an adapter owned there could only reach them by
// inverting that edge or by threading another RouterConfig field through main.
