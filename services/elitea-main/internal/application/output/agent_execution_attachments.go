// #607: the ADMISSION side of the attachment write-back.
//
// Pylon extracts a document's text once, at message-persist time, and stores it
// (rpc/chat_all.py:344-377 reads the files through the SDK artifact toolkit and
// appends the text as a second `{"type":"text"}` chunk of the item's `content`,
// with `flag_modified(item, "content")` at :376 because the column is `json`).
// Every later turn is then pure DB -- utils/chat_history.py:67-73 extends the
// stored chunks straight into the message and re-reads nothing.
//
// In this port the two halves are in different services: only the worker can
// reach the artifact toolkit, and only elitea-main can write
// `chat_messages_attachment`. AgentExecutionResultV1.attachment_contents is the
// seam. This file is what elitea-main is allowed to believe about what comes
// across it.

// AcceptedAgentExecutionAttachmentContents is the ONLY sanctioned way to build
// AgentExecutionResult.AttachmentContents from a wire frame. It returns the
// entries that may be persisted and DROPS the rest.
//
// WHY DROPPING, NOT FAILING THE RESULT. This decision is load-bearing, so it is
// written down rather than left to the shape of the code.
//
// The terminal projection is the path that RECORDS THE ASSISTANT'S ANSWER: the
// same transaction that would perform this write-back is the one that inserts
// the response's text item and clears `is_streaming`
// (repos/agent_execution_results.go, persistCurrentAgentTerminal). It runs once
// per settled terminal frame. Refusing the whole result over a malformed
// attachment entry would therefore not "reject a bad write-back" -- it would
// throw away the answer the user is already watching stream, permanently, and
// leave the message group streaming forever.
//
// The write-back, by contrast, is a CACHE of work that has already been done
// and already been used: the worker read the file this turn and spliced the
// text into the human message before it called the model, so the model saw it.
// Skipping the persistence degrades to exactly the pre-#607 behaviour -- a
// later turn sees the filename instead of the contents, and a turn that
// re-attaches re-pays the extraction. That is a smaller loss than the answer,
// by a wide margin, and it is recoverable (the next turn carrying the file
// extracts it again); a lost answer is not.
//
// It is also the rule ALREADY CHOSEN on the other side of the seam: the worker
// measures this list against MAX_ATTACHMENT_CONTENT_WRITEBACK_BYTES and drops
// whole entries that do not fit rather than failing its turn
// (agents/attachments.py, cited by the proto). Failing here would mean the two
// halves of one mechanism answer "what if it does not fit" differently.
//
// What dropping is NOT allowed to become is "write what we can and hope". Every
// refusal below drops a WHOLE entry, never part of one -- a partial chunk that
// still claims to be the file is worse than no chunk, because nothing
// downstream can tell the difference.

// stored object -- the shape pylon's `'{}'::json` column default leaves behind
// -- contributes nothing to a prompt, so writing one would be a silent erasure
// of the scaffold that IS there.

// The first element must be an object because that is the scaffold's header
// chunk, the one carrying the `elitea_attachment` marker. The marker is not
// decoration: it is what a later turn's worker reads to decide the file has
// already been extracted and must not be fetched again. This check cannot
// prove the marker survived byte-for-byte without parsing prose the worker
// owns, but it does refuse the shapes -- `[]`, `["text"]`, `[null]` -- in which
// it demonstrably did not.
//
// Beyond that the chunks are NOT inspected. Their content is the worker's and
