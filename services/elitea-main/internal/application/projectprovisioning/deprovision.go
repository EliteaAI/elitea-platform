package projectprovisioning

// Project deletion — the symmetric half issue #333 asks for.
//
// The reference is legacy/plugins/projects/api/v2/project.py's `delete_project`,
// which walks the same step list in REVERSE calling each step's `delete`. This
// reuses the very same `remove` functions the create path compensates with, so
// the two directions cannot drift apart: a step added to createSteps() is
// deleted here automatically, and a compensation bug shows up in both.

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

// ErrProjectNotFound reports a delete for a project id that has no row.
var ErrProjectNotFound = errors.New("projectprovisioning: project does not exist")

// ErrProjectNotRemoved reports a delete that ran every step and still left the
// project row behind.
var ErrProjectNotRemoved = errors.New("projectprovisioning: project was not removed")

// Deprovision removes a project and everything provisioning created for it.
//
// TWO DELIBERATE DEVIATIONS from the reference:
//
// First, the reference answers 200 whatever happens. Every one of its undo
// steps is individually try/except'd and the failures are only logged, so a
// delete that removed nothing at all is reported as a success — the
// "answers 200, did nothing" shape this codebase keeps re-shipping. Here the
// per-step results are still best-effort, because stopping at the first failure
// would strand the remaining resources; but the project row is RE-READ at the
// end, and a project that survived is an error rather than a 200.
//
// Second, the reference leaves auth_core__project_role and
// auth_core__project_user_role rows behind for every deleted project, because
// its ProjectPermissions and ProjectAdmin steps have no-op deletes. Those rows
// describe a project that no longer exists, and they resurface if the id is
// reused. removeProjectPermissions clears them.
