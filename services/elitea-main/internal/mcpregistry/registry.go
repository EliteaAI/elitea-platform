// Package mcpregistry is the durable store of MCP servers registered into a
// project, and the wire shape that `tools_list` serves from it (issue 335).
//
// # What the store replaces
//
// pylon keeps this data in process memory: `utils/mcp_servers_storage.py` holds
// two dictionaries on the plugin module, `project_id → name → McpServer` and
// `sid → project_id`. A socket.io client fills the first one when it connects,
// and a cron sweep drops entries whose socket has gone away. No row exists
// anywhere, in pylon or here, so the Go service had nothing to read and
// `tools_list` answered 501. The hybrid edge therefore sent worker traffic to
// pylon, and an agent with an MCP toolkit could not run without it.
//
// This package gives the same data a table. The store is written when the
// platform discovers a remote MCP server's tools, and read when a worker asks
// for the project's tool list.
//
// # What the store does NOT cover, and why that is not hidden
//
// pylon's dictionary has one writer this service cannot have: an Elitea MCP
// CLIENT that opens a socket.io connection and declares the servers it runs on
// the user's own machine. AGENTS.md's transport rules do not admit a socket.io
// server, and this service has never run one. Those registrations stay out of
// reach.
//
// That is why an empty list is now an honest answer where it was not before.
// Before this package, `[]` asserted "no client is connected", which this
// service could not know. Now `[]` reports the rows: no MCP server is
// registered in this project's store. A caller can act on that, because the
// same service that answers the read also owns the write.

// Tool is one tool that an MCP server publishes.
//
// The JSON tags are the wire contract, not a preference. The Python SDK reads
// `name`, `description` and the camelCase `inputSchema` from each entry
// (`elitea_sdk/runtime/toolkits/tools.py:_init_single_mcp_tool`), and gives
// `inputSchema` straight to the tool's argument model.

// returns.
//
// pylon serialises the `McpServer` pydantic model (`elitea_core/models/mcp.py`)
// with `model_dump(mode='json')` and returns a bare JSON array of them. The SDK
// reads `name` and `tools`; the remaining fields are part of the response pylon
// produces, so they stay, and a client that does read them keeps working.
//
// SioSID is always null here. It names the socket a tool call would be
// dispatched on, and this service runs no socket.io server. Emitting null
// rather than dropping the field keeps the shape identical and states the fact:
// there is no socket behind this entry.

// That order is preserved: a user's own registration overrides a shared one of
// the same name, which is what lets someone test a replacement server without
// changing the project everyone else uses.

// The result keeps the current-project order first, then the personal-only
// entries, so two reads of unchanged rows give the same list.
