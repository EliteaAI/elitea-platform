// The Gateway-API browser edge (#568).
//
// WHAT WAS MISSING.
//
// edge_root_routes_test.go walks the real Go router and fails when a
// root-mounted route matches no rule at the browser edge. It read TWO files,
// both of them traefik, both of them compose-only. The cluster runs neither.
// Its edge is a Gateway API HTTPRoute, it lived in the deployment repository
// alone, and no file here described it. So the walk could not reach it,
// `requiredWalkedFamilies` proved nothing about the cluster, and a green run
// was fully compatible with the cluster edge being a release behind.
//
// It was. PR #564 added four path prefixes to the compose edge. The cluster
// edge never got them, and project icons and author avatars stayed broken
// there for the whole 1.20.1 window. `/icons/1/a.png` answered the Gateway's
// own 404, byte-identical to an unrouted path.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE ADDS.
//
// deploy/gateway-api/httproute.yaml is now the reviewed source of that edge,
// and this file holds it to the same two rules the traefik edges answer to:
//
//  1. every root-mounted Go route is forwarded, or excluded with a reason;
//  2. every rule that reaches elitea-main removes the caller's identity
//     headers, and none of them removes the LLM gateway's hop marker.
//
// The classification uses assertPatternsClassified and assertNoStaleExclusions
// from edge_root_routes_test.go. Sharing them is the point: ONE definition of
// "classified" now covers all three edges, so widening it cannot reach the
// compose edges and leave the cluster behind — which is this defect.
//
// WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT COVER.
//
// The copy in the deployment repository. Nothing here reads the cluster, so a
// copy that stops tracking the file still deploys. Issue #568 names the second
// control for that gap: a post-deploy check of the root-mounted paths against
// the deployed host, discriminating on `vary: Origin`, which elitea-main sets
// and the Gateway's own 404 does not.
//
// RUN IT WITH -count=1, for the reason edge_middlewares_test.go gives: the
// files this gate reads live in deploy/, outside this module, so the test
// cache does not notice an edit to them.
