# image-scan-gate-test.sh — prove that scripts/ci/image-scan-gate.sh goes RED.
#
# ISSUE #501 asks for exactly this: "Prove the gate goes red. Do not assert it."
# A release gate is only worth its runtime if a real finding stops the release,
# and the way that claim usually rots is that nobody ever sees the gate fail.
#
# This test drives the gate with synthetic trivy reports. It needs no registry,
# no image, no network and no trivy — the gate reads a JSON report, so a report
# is all a test needs. Every arm is exercised:
#
#   * a clean report passes;
#   * one HIGH finding fails a blocking image;
#   * one CRITICAL finding fails a blocking image;
#   * a missing report fails         (the scan did not run);
#   * an empty report fails          (the same, written differently);
#   * a report that is not JSON fails (the scan did not finish);
#   * a report without the expected target type fails, EVEN WHEN IT HOLDS NO
#     FINDING — a dead scan must not look like a clean scan;
#   * an exempt image reports its findings and passes;
#   * an exempt image with zero findings FAILS, because the exemption is stale;
#   * the dormancy guards block the exempt image too;
#   * a `blocking` value that is neither true nor false is refused.
#
# Run it directly:
#   bash scripts/ci/image-scan-gate-test.sh
