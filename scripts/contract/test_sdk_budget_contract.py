"""Contract gate between the elitea-sdk budget reader and the gateway refusal.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
The gateway wrote a 402 that looked correct. The SCOPE of the refusal was in
error.type. Every Go test agreed with every other Go test, because all of them
restated the same wrong literal. elitea-sdk reads that body in one function,
``elitea_sdk/runtime/exceptions.py::budget_exceeded_from``. That function
matches on error.type ALONE, and it reads the scope from error.code. It thus
returned None. No typed exception came out. The policy refusal went to the
model as message content. Nothing failed.

This gate reads BOTH sides from source and compares them:

  * the SDK side comes from the pinned SDK tree at ELITEA_SDK_SOURCE_ROOT;
  * the gateway side comes from the Go source in this repository.

No literal from either contract is written into the assertions. A test that
restates a literal only proves that two copies of one mistake agree.

The SDK reader also runs for real here. The gate builds the body that the
gateway writes, gives it to the SDK function, and looks at the scope that comes
back. A structural check alone cannot see the defect above, because the
structure was correct: only the two values were in the wrong fields.

WHY THIS GATE MUST NOT SKIP QUIETLY
-----------------------------------
An absent input is the failure mode that this repository keeps finding: the
check reports a pass because it looked at nothing. When the SDK source is not
available, this gate FAILS under CI. It skips only for a local developer, and
the skip message names the variable to set.
